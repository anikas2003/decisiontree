      "i playing pilgrims christmas wont be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug its so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress i dont think its fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured sniff weve got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we havent got father and shall not have him for a long time she didnt say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we cant do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i dont and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted but i dont think the little we should spend would do any good weve each got a dollar and the army wouldnt be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself ive wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearthbrush and kettleholder i shall get a nice box of fabers drawingpencils i really need them said amy decidedly mother didnt say anything about our money and she wont wish us to give up everything lets each buy what we want and have a little fun im sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner i know i doteaching those tiresome children nearly all day when im longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again you dont have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till youre ready to fly out of the window or cry its naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i cant practise well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time i dont believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you dont have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you dont know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he isnt rich and insult you when your nose isnt nice if you mean libel id say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a picklebottle advised jo laughing i know what i mean and you neednt be statirical about it its proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity dont peck at one another children dont you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good wed be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun for ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug jo immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle dont jo its so boyish thats why i do it i detest rude unladylike girls i hate affected niminypiminy chits birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her eldersisterly fashion you are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it didnt matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady im not and if turning up my hair makes me one ill wear it in two tails till im twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think ive got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a chinaaster its bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like boys games and work and manners i cant get over my disappointment in not being a boy and its worse than ever now for im dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay at home and knit like a poky old woman and jo shook the blue armysock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room poor jo its too bad but it cant be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that all the dishwashing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch as for you amy continued meg you are altogether too particular and prim your airs are funny now but youll grow up an affected little goose if you dont take care i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you dont try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as jos slang if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture youre a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable old room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of homepeace pervaded it margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteenyearold jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didnt like it elizabethor beth as every one called herwas a rosy smoothhaired brighteyed girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little tranquillity and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important personin her own opinion at least a regular snowmaiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and every one brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easychair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze illustration beth put a pair of slippers down to warm they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair i thought id get her some with my dollar said beth no i shall cried amy im the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided im the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone ill tell you what well do said beth lets each get her something for christmas and not get anything for ourselves thats like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo every one thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth ill get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it wont cost much so ill have some left to buy my pencils added amy how will we give the things asked meg put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles dont you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo illustration i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air i dont mean to act any more after this time im getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about dressingup frolics you wont stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear goldpaper jewelry you are the best actress weve got and therell be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that i cant help it i never saw any one faint and i dont choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily ill drop if i cant i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i dont care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece illustration do it this way clasp your hands so do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest its no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laugh dont blame me come on meg then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha its the best weve had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows i dont see how you can write and act such splendid things jo youre a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witchs curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but id like to try macbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do no its the toasting fork with mothers shoe on it instead of the bread beths stagestruck cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a canihelpyou look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a noblelooking woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i didnt come home to dinner has any one called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easychair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the teatable jo brought wood and set chairs dropping overturning and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor and kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to every one as she sat with her hands folded as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face ive got a treat for you after supper a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there hurry and get done dont stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking in her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready i think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly dont i wish i could go as a drummer a vivanwhats its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of badtasting things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we wont ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the writers heart overflow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home illustration it was a cheerful hopeful letter give them all my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo wasnt ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mothers shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but ill truly try to be better so he maynt be disappointed in me by and by we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but wont any more if i can help it ill try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue armysock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home illustration how you used to play pilgrims progress mrs march broke the silence that followed jos words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piecebags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the hobgoblins were said jo i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs said meg my favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our flowers and arbors and pretty things were and all stood and sung for joy up there in the sunshine said beth smiling as if that pleasant moment had come back to her i dont remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i wasnt too old for such things id rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another our burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she hasnt got any said her mother yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people beths bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good its hard work and we forget and dont do our best we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little workbaskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted jos plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them illustration no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano at nine they stopped work and sung as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sung meg had a voice like a flute and she and her mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby illustration at nine they stopped work and sung as usual illustration a merry christmas ii a merry christmas jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was so crammed with goodies then she remembered her mothers promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little crimsoncovered book she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going the long journey she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow a greencovered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books alsoone dovecolored the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little nightcapped ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day then she opened her new book and began to read jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face how good meg is come amy lets do as they do ill help you with the hard words and theyll explain things if we dont understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example im glad mine is blue said amy and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later goodness only knows some poor creeter come abeggin and your ma went straight off to see what was needed there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time why where is amys bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new armyslippers how nice my handkerchiefs look dont they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor bless the child shes gone and put mother on them instead of m march how funny cried jo taking up one isnt it right i thought it was better to do it so because megs initials are m m and i dont want any one to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled its all right dear and a very pretty ideaquite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth theres mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early dont laugh at me jo i didnt mean any one should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and im truly trying not to be selfish any more as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and im so glad for mine is the handsomest now another bang of the streetdoor sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they cried in chorus merry christmas little daughters im glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously im so glad you came before we began may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly i shall take the cream and the muffins added amy heroically giving up the articles she most liked meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate i thought youd do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party illustration the procession set out a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them laughing in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birdslaughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english das ist gut die engelkinder cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they didnt get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning thats loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table shes coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with amys cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these homefestivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theatre and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work andnecessity being the mother of inventionmade whatever they needed very clever were some of their productionspasteboard guitars antique lamps made of oldfashioned butterboats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamondshaped bits left in sheets when the lids of tin preservepots were cut out the furniture was used to being turned topsyturvy and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels no gentlemen were admitted so jo played male parts to her hearts content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russetleather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were jos chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society on christmas night a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the dresscircle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lampsmoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clotheshorse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouched hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred to roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of hugos voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee illustration out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one to destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter hither hither from thy home airy sprite i bid thee come born of roses fed on dew charms and potions canst thou brew bring me here with elfin speed the fragrant philter which i need make it sweet and swift and strong spirit answer now my song illustration a little figure in cloudy white a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang hither i come from my airy home afar in the silver moon take the magic spell and use it well or its power will vanish soon and dropping a small gilded bottle at the witchs feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparitionnot a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she has cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stagecarpentering had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning at it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a ropeladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on roderigos shoulder and was about to leap gracefully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her trainit caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside dont laugh act as if it was all rightand ordering roderigo up banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall of the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred the effect of the villains death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his ladylove act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she wont hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and roderigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he doesnt make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don pedros blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace illustration the lovers kneeling to receive don pedros blessing tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cotbed on which the dresscircle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs marchs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheardof since the departed days of plenty there was icecreamactually two dishes of it pink and whiteand cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hothouse flowers it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely is it fairies asked amy its santa claus said beth mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march the laurence boys grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we dont know him exclaimed meg hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breadandmilk breakfast that boy put it into his head i know he did hes a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if hed like to know us but hes bashful and meg is so prim she wont let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction you mean the people who live in the big house next door dont you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says hes very proud and doesnt like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he isnt riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he didnt come mother says hes very nice though he never speaks to us girls our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitallyall about cricket and so onwhen he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun im sure he does said jo decidedly illustration we talked over the fence i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so ive no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own its a mercy you didnt mother laughed jo looking at her boots but well have another play some time that he can see perhaps hell help act wouldnt that be jolly i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest they are lovely but beths roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the halfdead posy in her belt beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father im afraid he isnt having such a merry christmas as we are illustration tailpiece illustration eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe iii the laurence boy jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old threelegged sofa by the sunny window this was jos favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didnt mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on newyears eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear whats the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we havent got anything else answered jo with her mouth full if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when im eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait im sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i cant take any out you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they arent as nice as id like mine are spoilt with lemonade and i cant get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress you must have gloves or i wont go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you cant dance without them and if you dont i should be so mortified then ill stay still i dont care much for company dancing its no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers you cant ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoilt the others that she shouldnt get you any more this winter cant you make them do asked meg anxiously i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are thats all i can do no ill tell you how we can manageeach wear one good one and carry a bad one dont you see your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her then ill go without i dont care what people say cried jo taking up her book you may have it you may only dont stain it and do behave nicely dont put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you dont worry about me ill be as prim as i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble on newyears eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressingmaids and the two elder were absorbed in the allimportant business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burnt hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs illustration jo undertook to pinch the papered locks ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed its the dampness drying replied jo what a queer smell its like burnt feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air there now ill take off the papers and youll see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim oh oh oh what have you done im spoilt i cant go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead just my luck you shouldnt have asked me to do it i always spoil everything im so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so ive made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the black pancakes with tears of regret it isnt spoilt just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion ive seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly serves me right for trying to be fine i wish id let my hair alone cried meg petulantly so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the family jos hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suitsmeg in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine megs highheeled slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and jos nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk dont eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window girls girls have you both got nice pockethandkerchiefs yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own now dont forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs gardiners dressingroom after a prolonged prink i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush no winking isnt ladylike ill lift my eyebrows if anything is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulders straight and take short steps and dont shake hands if you are introduced to any one it isnt the thing how do you learn all the proper ways i never can isnt that music gay illustration mrs gardiner greeted them down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who didnt care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flowergarden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group near her dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burnt breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big redheaded youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy illustration face to face with the laurence boy dear me i didnt know any one was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled dont mind me stay if you like shant i disturb you not a bit i only came here because i dont know many people and felt rather strange at first you know so did i dont go away please unless youd rather the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think ive had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us dont you next door and he looked up and laughed outright for jos prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present grandpa sent it but you put it into his head didnt you now how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march im only jo returned the young lady im not mr laurence im only laurie laurie laurencewhat an odd name my first name is theodore but i dont like it for the fellows called me dora so i made them say laurie instead i hate my name tooso sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora i thrashed em i cant thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh dont you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and every one is lively in a place like this im sure to upset something tread on peoples toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about dont you dance sometimes you see ive been abroad a good many years and havent been into company enough yet to know how you do things here abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels laurie didnt seem to know where to begin but jos eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went walking trips about switzerland with their teachers dont i wish id been there cried jo did you go to paris we spent last winter there can you talk french we were not allowed to speak any thing else at vevay do say some i can read it but cant pronounce quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis said laurie goodnaturedly how nicely you do it let me seeyou said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers didnt you oui mademoiselle its my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and criticised and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances lauries bashfulness soon wore off for jos gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is it was on the tip of jos tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a roundabout way i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your booksno i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her laurie smiled but didnt seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i wont go before seventeen anyway arent you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already sixteen next month how i wish i was going to college you dont look as if you liked it i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i dont like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time thats a splendid polka why dont you go and try it if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow i cant for i told meg i wouldnt because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh because what asked laurie curiously you wont tell never well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though its nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know but laurie didnt laugh he only looked down a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that ill tell you how we can manage theres a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice pearlcolored ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a sideroom where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale illustration they sat down on the stairs ive sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i dont know how im ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain i knew youd hurt your feet with those silly shoes im sorry but i dont see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke i cant have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i cant get one at all for most people come in their own and its a long way to the stable and no one to send ill go no indeed its past nine and dark as egypt i cant stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her ill rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can ill ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her mercy no dont ask or tell any one get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i cant dance any more but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she comes they are going out to supper now ill stay with you id rather no dear run along and bring me some coffee im so tired i cant stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the diningroom which she found after going into a chinacloset and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilt thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing megs glove by scrubbing her gown with it can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and some one shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffeecolored glove too bad i was looking for some one to give this to may i take it to your sister oh thank you ill show you where she is i dont offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second instalment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or three other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain hush dont say anything she whispered adding aloud its nothing i turned my foot a little thats all and limped upstairs to put her things on hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till she decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his grandfathers carriage which had just come for him he said its so early you cant mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer i always go earlyi do truly please let me take you home its all on my way you know and it rains they say that settled it and telling him of megs mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable yes till i hurt myself sallies friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought i saw you dancing with the redheaded man i ran away from was he nice oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i couldnt help laughing did you hear us no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out tell about the party tell about the party with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressinggown with a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair i dont believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burnt hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right illustration tell about the party illustration the kitten stuck like a burr just out of reach iv burdens oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked i wish it was christmas or newyear all the time wouldnt it be fun answered jo yawning dismally we shouldnt enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work its like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things im so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby well we cant have it so dont let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does im sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when ive learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i shant mind her this idea tickled jos fancy and put her in good spirits but meg didnt brighten for her burden consisting of four spoilt children seemed heavier than ever she hadnt heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neckribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way wheres the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether im pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because im poor and cant enjoy my life as other girls do its a shame so meg went down wearing an injured look and wasnt at all agreeable at breakfasttime every one seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she couldnt find her rubbers jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready mrs march was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and hannah had the grumps for being up late didnt suit her there never was such a cross family cried jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both bootlacings and sat down upon her hat youre the crossest person in it returned amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate beth if you dont keep these horrid cats down cellar ill have them drowned exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach jo laughed meg scolded beth implored and amy wailed because she couldnt remember how much nine times twelve was girls girls do be quiet one minute i must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried mrs march crossing out the third spoilt sentence in her letter there was a momentary lull broken by hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again these turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two cuddle your cats and get over your headache bethy goodby marmee we are a set of rascals this morning but well come home regular angels now then meg and jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them somehow it seemed as if they couldnt have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind dont use such dreadful expressions said meg from the depths of the vail in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world i like good strong words that mean something replied jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether call yourself any names you like but i am neither a rascal nor a wretch and i dont choose to be called so youre a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you cant sit in the lap of luxury all the time poor dear just wait till i make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and icecream and highheeled slippers and posies and redheaded boys to dance with how ridiculous you are jo but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself lucky for you i am for if i put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up dont croak any more but come home jolly theres a dear jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of pleasureloving youth when mr march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty goodwill which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary as she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown she tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life at the kings she daily saw all she wanted for the childrens older sisters were just out and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty balldresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theatres concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her poor meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward every one sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined other friends told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old ladys will but the unworldly marches only said we cant give up our girls for a dozen fortunes rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another the old lady wouldnt speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at a friends something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old ladys fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every ones surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative there was an occasional tempest and once jo had marched home declaring she couldnt bear it any longer but aunt march always cleared up quickly and sent for her back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about the queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cosy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easychair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of the song or the most perilous adventure of her traveller a shrill voice called josyphine josyphine and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read belshams essays by the hour together illustration curling herself up in the big chair jos ambition was to do something very splendid what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldnt read run and ride as much as she liked a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic but the training she received at aunt marchs was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual josyphine beth was too bashful to go to school it had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the ragbag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid if any one had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe the air hidden under her coat she sung it lullabys and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope youll have a good night my poor dear beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she couldnt take music lessons and have a fine piano she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practised away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if some one not to hint aunt march ought to help her nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that wouldnt keep in tune when she was all alone she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired to play for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know ill get my music some time if im good there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose when she was a baby jo had accidentally dropped her into the coalhod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever it was not big nor red like poor petreas it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment she was a great favorite with her mates being goodtempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for beside her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than two thirds of the words she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did soandso which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls amy was in a fair way to be spoilt for every one petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely one thing however rather quenched the vanities she had to wear her cousins clothes now florences mamma hadnt a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit everything was good well made and little worn but amys artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother dont take tucks in my dresses whenever im naughty as maria parks mother does my dear its really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she cant come to school when i think of this deggerredation i feel that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it meg was amys confidant and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle beths to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big harumscarum sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than any one in the family the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women has anybody got anything to tell its been such a dismal day im really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it ill tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once illustration reading that everlasting belsham i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a topheavy dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt id just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud aunt woke up and being more goodnatured after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham i did my very best and she liked it though she only said i dont understand what its all about go back and begin it child back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly im afraid it tires you maam shant i stop now she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and dont be impertinent miss did she own she liked it asked meg oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she didnt hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming what a pleasant life she might have if she only chose i dont envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo that reminds me said meg that ive got something to tell it isnt funny like jos story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away i heard mrs king crying and mr king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i shouldnt see how red their eyes were i didnt ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i hadnt any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might well she drew a picture of mr davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the ear the ear just fancy how horridand led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half an hour holding that slate so every one could see illustration he took her by the ear by the ear didnt the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape laugh not one they sat as still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did i didnt envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldnt have made me happy after that i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath i saw something that i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting jos topsyturvy basket in order as she talked when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr laurence was in the fishshop but he didnt see me for i kept behind a barrel and he was busy with mr cutter the fishman a poor woman came in with a pail and a mop and asked mr cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she hadnt any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a days work mr cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her she was so glad and surprised she took it right in her arms and thanked him over and over he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy wasnt it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr laurences bed in heaven would be aisy illustration mr laurence hooked up a big fish when they had laughed at beths story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me yes maam i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and im going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital he answered quietly you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity not a mite more than i ought maam id go myself if i was any use as i aint i give my boys and give em free he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself id given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say good by to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me tell another story motherone with a moral to it like this i like to think about them afterwards if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a minutes silence mrs march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if we only had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many pleasant things they actually could do so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were one discovered that money couldnt keep shame and sorrow out of rich peoples houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who couldnt enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to have to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old womans advice now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg i like that kind of sermon its the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on jos cushion i dont complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for ive had warning from susies downfall said amy morally we needed that lesson and we wont forget it if we do you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them illustration tailpiece v being neighborly illustration being neighborly what in the world are you going to do now jo asked meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough its cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver never take advice cant keep still all day and not being a pussycat i dont like to doze by the fire i like adventures and im going to find some meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coachhouse and wellkept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson to jos lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were snowballing one another that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know whats good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively ive a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr laurence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quietcurtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day its a shame ill toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out how do you do are you sick illustration laurie opened the window laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven better thank you ive had a bad cold and been shut up a week im sorry what do you amuse yourself with nothing its as dull as tombs up here dont you read not much they wont let me cant somebody read to you grandpa does sometimes but my books dont interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time have some one come and see you then there isnt any one id like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak isnt there some nice girl whod read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse dont know any you know us began jo then laughed and stopped so i do will you come please cried laurie im not quiet and nice but ill come if mother will let me ill go ask her shut that window like a good boy and wait till i come with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh collar and trying to tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring then a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprisedlooking servant came running up to announce a young lady all right show her up its miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and kind and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and beths three kittens in the other here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew youd laugh at them but i couldnt refuse she was so anxious to do something it so happened that beths funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blancmange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of amys pet geranium it isnt anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea its so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cosy room this is it might be if it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i dont know how to make them mind it worries me though ill right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed soand the things made straight on the mantelpiece soand the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then youre fixed and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully how kind you are yes thats what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by thank you ive read all those and if you dont mind id rather talk answered laurie not a bit ill talk all day if youll only set me going beth says i never know when to stop is beth the rosy one who stays at home a good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest yes thats beth shes my girl and a regular good one she is too the pretty one is meg and the curlyhaired one is amy i believe how did you find that out laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when im alone up here i cant help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted its like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all round the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i cant help watching it i havent got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to jos warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in homelove and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said well never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping youd come over and see us mother is so splendid shed do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and wed have jolly times wouldnt your grandpa let you i think he would if your mother asked him hes very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only hes afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more we are not strangers we are neighbors and you neednt think youd be a bother we want to know you and ive been trying to do it this ever so long we havent been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you you see grandpa lives among his books and doesnt mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor doesnt stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can thats bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then youll have plenty of friends and pleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it wont last long if you keep going laurie turned red again but wasnt offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much goodwill in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased dont go to school im a business mangirl i mean i go to wait on my greataunt and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it wasnt manners to make too many inquiries into peoples affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable jo liked his good breeding and didnt mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she revelled laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter illustration poll tweaked off his wig oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofacushion red and shining with merriment much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to jos delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself if you like them so much come down and see ours grandpa is out so you neednt be afraid said laurie getting up im not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head i dont believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met him in some of his moods the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepyhollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velvet chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the world she added impressively a fellow cant live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite before he could say more a bell rung and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me its your grandpa well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i dont know why i should be marmee said i might come and i dont think youre any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door im a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged im only afraid you are very tired talking to me it was so pleasant i couldnt bear to stop said laurie gratefully the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie dont mind me im as happy as a cricket here answered jo laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly im sure now that i shouldnt be afraid of him for hes got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own he isnt as handsome as my grandfather but i like him thank you maam said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence poor jo blushed till she couldnt blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy gray eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after that dreadful pause so youre not afraid of me hey not much sir and you dont think me as handsome as your grandfather not quite sir and ive got a tremendous will have i i only said i thought so but you like me in spite of it yes i do sir that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod youve got your grandfathers spirit if you havent his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend illustration putting his finger under her chin thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put only trying to be neighborly sir and jo told how her visit came about you think he needs cheering up a bit do you yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we dont forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly tut tut tut that was the boys affair how is the poor woman doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were just her fathers way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so theres the teabell we have it early on the boys account come down and go on being neighborly if youd like to have me sir shouldnt ask you if i didnt and mr laurence offered her his arm with oldfashioned courtesy what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running down stairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astonishing sight of jo arminarm with his redoubtable grandfather i didnt know youd come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance thats evident by the way you racket down stairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the boys hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the boys face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh shes right the lad is lonely ill see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung above herwhile her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much illustration please give these to your mother they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawingroom but jos attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression sometimes he answered modestly please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth wont you first dont know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tearoses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and didnt put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to the rescue that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music isnt bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well im much obliged to you and i hope youll come again my respects to your mother goodnight doctor jo he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said anything amiss he shook his head no it was me he doesnt like to hear me play why not ill tell you some day john is going home with you as i cant no need of that i am not a young lady and its only a step take care of yourself wont you yes but you will come again i hope if you promise to come and see us after you are well i will goodnight laurie goodnight jo goodnight when all the afternoons adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues mother why didnt mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition i am not sure but i think it was because his son lauries father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said dear me how romantic exclaimed meg how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go thats why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him he meant the blancmange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before i never saw such a girl you dont know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter i think they are great nonsense and ill thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun lauries a nice boy and i like him and i wont have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish well all be good to him because he hasnt got any mother and he may come over and see us maynt he marmee yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can i dont call myself a child and im not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth i was thinking about our pilgrims progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect illustration tailpiece vi beth finds the palace beautiful the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions old mr laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs marchs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simplehearted girls never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterwards said the old gentleman the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise i suspect she is right and that ive been coddling the fellow as if id been his grandmother let him do what he likes as long as he is happy he cant get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs march is doing more for him than we can what good times they had to be sure such plays and tableaux such sleighrides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her hearts content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano no persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr laurences ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and told such charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with the excitement of this unusual performance taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr laurence talked on about lauries lessons and teachers and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs march the boy neglects his music now and im glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use wouldnt some of your girls like to run over and practise on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know maam beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile they neednt see or speak to any one but run in at any time for im shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawingroom after nine oclock here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they dont care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way o sir they do care very very much illustration o sir they do care very much are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly im beth i love it dearly and ill come if you are quite sure nobody will hear meand be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke not a soul my dear the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged to you how kind you are sir beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed her saying in a tone few people ever heard i had a little girl once with eyes like these god bless you my dear good day madam and away he went in a great hurry beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not at home how blithely she sung that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the sidedoor and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawingroom where her idol stood quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state of beatitude after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawingroom was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen she never knew that mr laurence often opened his studydoor to hear the oldfashioned airs he liked she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away she never suspected that the exercisebooks and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what isnt always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her at any rate she deserved both illustration mr laurence often opened his study door mother im going to work mr laurence a pair of slippers he is so kind to me i must thank him and i dont know any other way can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his yes dear it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs march who took peculiar pleasure in granting beths requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun a cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before any one got tired of them then she wrote a very short simple note and with lauries help got them smuggled on to the studytable one morning before the old gentleman was up when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen all that day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgment arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety friend on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed heres a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it o beth hes sent you began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinetpiano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a signboard to miss elizabeth march for me gasped beth holding on to jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether yes all for you my precious isnt it splendid of him dont you think hes the dearest old man in the world heres the key in the letter we didnt open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note you read it i cant i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in jos apron quite upset by her present jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first words she saw were miss march dear madam how nice it sounds i wish some one would write to me so said amy who thought the oldfashioned address very elegant i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continued jo heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little granddaughter he lost with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant james laurence there beth thats an honor to be proud of im sure laurie told me how fond mr laurence used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully just think hes given you her piano that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green silk puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties your humble servant james laurence only think of his writing that to you ill tell the girls theyll think its splendid said amy much impressed by the note try it honey lets hear the sound of the babypianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows so beth tried it and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard it had evidently been newly tuned and put in applepie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm of it lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals youll have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the childs really going never entered her head yes i mean to i guess ill go now before i get frightened thinking about it and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door well i wish i may die if it aint the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head shed never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward if you will believe me she went and knocked at the studydoor before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for but she didnt finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him illustration she put both arms around his neck and kissed him if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman wouldnt have been more astonished but he liked itoh dear yes he liked it amazinglyand was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with uplifted hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end vii amys valley of humiliation illustration the cyclops that boy is a perfect cyclops isnt he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed how dare you say so when hes got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend i didnt say anything about his eyes and i dont see why you need fire up when i admire his riding oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter you neednt be so rude its only a lapse of lingy as mr davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at amys second blunder i need it so much im dreadfully in debt and it wont be my turn to have the ragmoney for a month in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i cant pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop tell me all about it are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too its nothing but limes now for every one is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils beadrings paper dolls or something else at recess if one girl likes another she gives her a lime if shes mad with her she eats one before her face and dont offer even a suck they treat by turns and ive had ever so many but havent returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you dont you like limes not much you may have my share heres the money make it last as long as you can for it isnt very plenty you know oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocketmoney ill have a grand feast for i havent tasted a lime this week i felt delicate about taking any as i couldnt return them and im actually suffering for one next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist brownpaper parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twentyfour delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kingsley insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss snows cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other peoples limes and stuckup people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow girls hopes by the withering telegram you neednt be so polite all of a sudden for you wont get any a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and amys beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretence of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this muchenduring man had succeeded in banishing chewinggum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private postoffice had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity young ladies attention if you please at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance miss march come to the desk amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat dont take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath is that all not quite stammered amy bring the rest immediately with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed you are sure there are no more i never lie sir so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couplelooking oh so plump and juicyfell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes thisthis was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate limelover burst into tears as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and its my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the culprits fate your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw back her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down illustration amy bore without flinching several tingling blows you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stovefunnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it very hard to study with that pathetic figure before them during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to any one straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle no notice was taken of amys flight except by her mates but the sharpeyed demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected amys property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the doormat as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i dont approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr daviss manner of teaching and dont think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your fathers advice before i send you anywhere else thats good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school its perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but im not sure that it wont do you more good than a milder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she didnt know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and wouldnt have believed it if any one had told her i wish id known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me im so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly you do know her and she helps you better than any one else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofacushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery illustration you do know her jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sung delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all the evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoilt by petting replied her mother and he isnt conceited is he asked amy not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much i see its nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully these things are always seen and felt in a persons manner and conversation if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march any more than its proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know youve got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh illustration girls where are you going viii jo meets apollyon girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity never mind little girls shouldnt ask questions returned jo sharply now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i havent got anything to do and am so lonely i cant dear because you arent invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you cant go amy so dont be a baby and whine about it you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in arent you going with him yes we are now do be still and stop bothering amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket i know i know youre going to the theatre to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and ive got my ragmoney and it was mean not to tell me in time just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother doesnt wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time i dont like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me ive been sick with this cold so long and shut up im dying for some fun do meg ill be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could suppose we take her i dont believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg if she goes i shant and if i dont laurie wont like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think shed hate to poke herself where she isnt wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie hasnt anything to do with it you cant sit with us for our seats are reserved and you mustnt sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or hell get another seat for you and that isnt proper when you werent asked you shant stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her grownup ways and acted like a spoilt child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone youll be sorry for this jo march see if you aint fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake were as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and gorgeous princes and princesses jos pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy queens yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least selfcontrol and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat jos first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning jos top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has any one taken my book meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute amy youve got it no i havent you know where it is then no i dont thats a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy it isnt i havent got it dont know where it is now and dont care you know something about it and youd better tell at once or ill make you and jo gave her a slight shake scold as much as you like youll never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn why not i burnt it up illustration i burnt it up what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burnt it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously yes i did i told you id make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so amy got no farther for jos hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and ill never forgive you as long as i live meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her sisters ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister jos book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that amys bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them when the teabell rung jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all amys courage to say meekly please forgive me jo im very very sorry i never shall forgive you was jos stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely no one spoke of the great troublenot even mrs marchfor all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened jos resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet homepeace was disturbed they felt this most when singingtime came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sung alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune as jo received her goodnight kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear dont let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldnt quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she dont deserve to be forgiven with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thundercloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of fidgets meg was pensive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldnt try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ill ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but its no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me dont say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them dont say anything till jo has got goodnatured with laurie then take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and im sure shell be friends again with all her heart ill try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap ill go on to the first bend and see if its all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his furtrimmed coat and cap jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sisters troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back keep near the shore it isnt safe in the middle jo heard but amy was just struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling at her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with the sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made jos heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a terrorstricken face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and lauries voice cried out bring a rail quick quick how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite selfpossessed and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt illustration held amy up by his arms and hockey now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice quite safe dear she is not hurt and wont even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her its my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever o mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried harder than ever you dont know you cant guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when im in a passion i get so savage i could hurt any one and enjoy it im afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me o mother help me do help me i will my child i will dont cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise ive been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before yes ive learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up jos dishevelled hair how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles mefor the sharp words fly out before i know what im about and the more i say the worse i get till its a pleasure to hurt peoples feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear my good mother used to help me as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to any one else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but by and by when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything poor mother what helped you then your father jo he never loses patiencenever doubts or complainsbut always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practise all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy o mother if im ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a warning remember it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight or went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look jo saw that her mothers eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i didnt mean to be rude but its so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here my jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them i thought id grieved you no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him yet you told him to go mother and didnt cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i dont seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him the nearer you will feel to him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but may become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother jos only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of selfdenial and selfcontrol and led by her mothers hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before i let the sun go down on my anger i wouldnt forgive her and today if it hadnt been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to jos heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss illustration packing the go abroady trunk ix meg goes to vanity fair i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms and such lovely weather im so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her sisters cushion i wish you were all going but as you cant i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back im sure its the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes what did mother give you out of the treasurebox asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there isnt time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan it will look nicely over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i hadnt smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use there is a lovely oldfashioned pearl set in the treasurebox but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see theres my new gray walkingsuitjust curl up the feather in my hat beththen my poplin for sunday and the small partyit looks heavy for spring doesnt it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear never mind youve got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted it isnt lownecked and it doesnt sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if id got a new one my silk sacque isnt a bit the fashion and my bonnet doesnt look like sallies i didnt like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle its strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside annies silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor change it advised jo i wont be so silly or hurt marmees feelings when she took so much pains to get my things its a nonsensical notion of mine and im not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glovebox annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hannahs hands no i wouldnt for the smart caps wont match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks shouldnt rig said jo decidedly i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently you said the other day that youd be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie moffats observed beth in her quiet way so i did well i am happy and i wont fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants doesnt it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my balldress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the halffilled trunk to the manytimes pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her balldress with an important air the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she had begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie moffats pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and muchinjured girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theatres and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done every one petted her and daisy as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin wouldnt do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside sallies crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within its for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff they are for miss march the man said and heres a note put in the maid holding it to meg what fun who are they from didnt know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy brighteyed face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didnt strike her as so very shabby now she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her hearts content every one was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she didnt dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of a conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall how old is he sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice it would be a grand thing for one of those girls wouldnt it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently doesnt think of it yet said mrs moffat she told that fib about her mamma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing shed be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think shed be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice shes proud but i dont believe shed mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one well see i shall ask young laurence as a compliment to her and well have fun about it afterward illustration megs partner appeared here megs partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet wellmeant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoilt by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor mans daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven poor meg had a restless night and got up heavyeyed unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air daisy dear ive sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and its only a proper compliment to you meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but im afraid he wont come why not chrie asked miss belle hes too old my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing there isnt any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover about your age nan said nearer my sister jos i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head its very nice of him to send you flowers isnt it said annie looking wise about nothing yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more its evident daisy isnt out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug im going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace no thank you maam replied sallie ive got my new pink silk for thursday and dont want a thing nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them what shall you wear asked sallie my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable why dont you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady i havent got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isnt out theres no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for ive got a sweet blue silk laid away which ive outgrown and you shall wear it to please me wont you dear you are very kind but i dont mind my old dress if you dont it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and youd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i shant let any one see you till you are done and then well burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone meg couldnt refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the moffats on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a skyblue dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of tearosebuds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of highheeled blue silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a laced handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a silver holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll mademoiselle is charmante trs jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like the jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and dont any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success im afraid to go down i feel so queer and stiff and halfdressed said meg to sallie as the bell rang and mrs moffat sent to ask the young ladies to appear at once you dont look a bit like yourself but you are very nice im nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and youre quite french i assure you let your flowers hang dont be so careful of them and be sure you dont trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself illustration asked to be introduced keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawingrooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on sofas and criticised the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them daisy marchfather a colonel in the armyone of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs moffats fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a sideache the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i wont care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend im glad you came i was afraid you wouldnt she said with her most grownup air jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time i shall say i didnt know you for you look so grownup and unlike yourself im quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glovebutton how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it wouldnt jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not yes i think she would returned laurie gravely dont you like me so asked meg no i dont was the blunt reply why not in an anxious tone he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not a particle of his usual politeness about it i dont like fuss and feathers that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoilt her entirely shes nothing but a doll tonight oh dear sighed meg i wish id been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed myself she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me im afraid it will be too disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely not a bit of it im dying to do it come ill be good i dont like your gown but i do think you arejust splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt dont trip you up its the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practised at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why wont i said laurie with alacrity please dont tell them at home about my dress tonight they wont understand the joke and it will worry mother then why did you do it said lauries eyes so plainly that meg hastily added i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly ive been but id rather do it myself so youll not tell will you i give you my word i wont only what shall i say when they ask me just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time ill say the first with all my heart but how about the other you dont look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper no not just now dont think im horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort doesnt pay i find and im getting tired of it here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party he put his name down for three dances and i suppose hes coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed illustration i wouldnt meg youll have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i wouldnt meg your mother doesnt like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan im not meg tonight im a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again she answered with an affected little laugh wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off illpleased at the change he saw in her meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say goodnight remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun silence la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away this little bit of byplay excited annies curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadnt enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fortnights fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it isnt splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening im glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in childrens faces meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking beths stool leaned her elbows on her mothers knee saying bravely marmee i want to fess i thought so what is it dear shall i go away asked jo discreetly of course not dont i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious i told you they dressed me up but i didnt tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashionplate laurie thought i wasnt proper i know he did though he didnt say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg selfreproachfully there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly yes its very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into megs innocent mind well if that isnt the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why didnt you pop out and tell them so on the spot i couldnt it was so embarrassing for me i couldnt help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i didnt remember that i ought to go away just wait till i see annie moffat and ill show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because hes rich and may marry us by and by wont he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke if you tell laurie ill never forgive you she mustnt must she mother said meg looking distressed no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so littlekind i dare say but worldly illbred and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg dont be sorry i wont let it hurt me ill forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go ill not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know im a silly little girl and ill stay with you till im fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i cant help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs moffats i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way illustration holding a hand of each mrs march said c i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the worldmarry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thingand when well used a noble thingbut i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for id rather see you poor mens wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without selfrespect and peace poor girls dont stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg then well be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly dont be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so loveworthy that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidant father to be your friend and both of us trust and hope that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of our lives we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them goodnight x the p c and p o as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say id know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters megs had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orangetree in it jos bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sunflowers the seeds of which cheerful and aspiring plant were to feed aunt cockletop and her family of chicks beth had oldfashioned fragrant flowers in her gardensweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the bird and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hersrather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look atwith honeysuckles and morningglories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there gardening walks rows

fashion it was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big p c in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who revelled in pens and ink was the editor at seven oclock the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she couldnt was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they goodnaturedly reminded each other of their faults and shortcomings illustration mr pickwick on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glasses rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read the pickwick portfolio may 20

the masked marriage a tale of venice gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count de adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flowergirls all mingled gayly in the dance sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell upon the gay throng and not a sound but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orangegroves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a low murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage s pickwick why is the p c like the tower of babel it is full of unruly members the history of a squash once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes one day in october when they were ripe he picked one and took it to market a grocerman bought and put it in his shop that same morning a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress with a round face and snub nose went and bought it for her mother she lugged it home cut it up and boiled it in the big pot mashed some of it with salt and butter for dinner and to the rest she added a pint of milk two eggs four spoons of sugar nutmeg and some crackers put it in a deep dish and baked it till it was brown and nice and next day it was eaten by a family named march t tupman mr pickwick sir i address you upon the subject of sin the sinner i mean is a man named winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and sometimes wont write his piece in this fine paper i hope you will pardon his badness and let him send a french fable because

accident on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to

leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr snodgrass rose to make a proposition mr president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new memberone who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice i propose mr theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p c come now do have him jos sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat well put it to vote said the president all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying ay a loud response from snodgrass followed to everybodys surprise by a timid one from beth contrary minded say no meg and amy were contrary minded and mr winkle rose to say with great elegance we dont wish any boys they only joke and bounce about this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper im afraid hell laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful up rose snodgrass very much in earnest sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie wont do anything of the sort he likes to write and hell give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental dont you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly now then vote again everybody remember its our laurie and say ay cried snodgrass excitedly ay ay ay replied three voices at once good bless you now as theres nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a ragbag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter illustration jo threw open the door of the closet you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr president and ladiesi beg pardon gentlemenallow me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warmingpan on which she leaned my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing come now dont lay it all on yourself you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly never you mind what she says im the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr pickwick but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth dewote myself to the interest of this immortal club hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warmingpan like a cymbal go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a postoffice in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mailsalso the females if i may be allowed the expression its the old martinhouse but ive stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat great applause as mr weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warmingpan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored a long discussion followed and every one came out surprising for every one did her best so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted wellbehaved and jovial member no club could have he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodelled her own works with good effect she thought the p o was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real office tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles gardenseeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with hannahs charms actually sent a loveletter to jos care how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many loveletters that little postoffice would hold in the years to come illustration jo spent the morning on the river xi experiments the first of june the kings are off to the seashore tomorrow and im free three months vacationhow i shall enjoy it exclaimed meg coming home one warm day to find jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion while beth took off her dusty boots and amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party aunt march went today for which oh be joyful said jo i was mortally afraid shed ask me to go with her if she had i should have felt as if i ought to do it but plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard you know and id rather be excused we had a flurry getting the old lady off and i had a fright every time she spoke to me for i was in such a hurry to be through that i was uncommonly helpful and sweet and feared shed find it impossible to part from me i quaked till she was fairly in the carriage and had a final fright for as it drove off she popped out her head saying josyphine wont you i didnt hear any more for i basely turned and fled i did actually run and whisked round the corner where i felt safe poor old jo she came in looking as if bears were after her said beth as she cuddled her sisters feet with a motherly air aunt march is a regular samphire is she not observed amy tasting her mixture critically she means vampire not seaweed but it doesnt matter its too warm to be particular about ones parts of speech murmured jo what shall you do all your vacation asked amy changing the subject with tact i shall lie abed late and do nothing replied meg from the depths of the rockingchair ive been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people so now im going to rest and revel to my hearts content no said jo that dozy way wouldnt suit me ive laid in a heap of books and im going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old appletree when im not having l dont say larks implored amy as a return snub for the samphire correction ill say nightingales then with laurie thats proper and appropriate since hes a warbler dont let us do any lessons beth for a while but play all the time and rest as the girls mean to proposed amy well i will if mother doesnt mind i want to learn some new songs and my children need fitting up for the summer they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes may we mother asked meg turning to mrs march who sat sewing in what they called marmees corner you may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it i think by saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play oh dear no it will be delicious im sure said meg complacently i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day next morning meg did not appear till ten oclock her solitary breakfast did not taste nice and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and amys books lay scattered about nothing was neat and pleasant but marmees corner which looked as usual and there meg sat to rest and read which meant yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the appletree beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment topsyturvy and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckles hoping some one would see and inquire who the young artist was as no one appeared but an inquisitive daddylonglegs who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping illustration amy sat down to draw at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wouldnt wash which mishap made her slightly cross jo had burnt the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy browns party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely she smiled said nothing and with hannahs help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and revelling process the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers an unsettled feeling possessed every one and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up la moffat jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even goodnatured laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquillity was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse and care for herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden she didnt like dolls fairytales were childish and one couldnt draw all the time teaparties didnt amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go travelling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grownup boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the diningroom and no mother anywhere to be seen mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed mother isnt sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can its a very queer thing for her to do she doesnt act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so we mustnt grumble but take care of ourselves thats easy enough and i like the idea im aching for something to dothat is some new amusement you know added jo quickly in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of hannahs saying housekeeping aint no joke there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did so why servants ever talked about hard work i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for shed take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot so a tray was fitted out before any one began and taken up with the cooks compliments the boiled tea was very bitter the omelette scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone poor little souls they will have a hard time im afraid but they wont suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurta motherly little deception for which they were grateful many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures never mind ill get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner youd better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act oh theres corned beef and plenty of potatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says well have lettuce and make a salad i dont know how but the book tells ill have blancmange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant dont try too many messes jo for you cant make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat i wash my hands of the dinnerparty and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him i dont want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding youll give me your advice if i get in a muddle wont you asked jo rather hurt yes but i dont know much except about bread and a few trifles you had better ask mothers leave before you order anything returned meg prudently of course i shall im not a fool and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers get what you like and dont disturb me im going out to dinner and cant worry about things at home said mrs march when jo spoke to her i never enjoyed housekeeping and im going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some natural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going down stairs theres beth crying thats a sure sign that something is wrong with this family if amy is bothering ill shake her feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died its all my faulti forgot himthere isnt a seed or a drop left o pip o pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him illustration o pip o pip jo peeped into his halfopen eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her dominobox for a coffin put him in the oven and maybe he will get warm and revive said amy hopefully hes been starved and he shant be baked now hes dead ill make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and ill never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go now dont cry bethy its a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinnerparty well have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out heres a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stovedoor open and poking vigorously among the cinders having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargains she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was redhot hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and dishevelled figure appeared demanding tartly i say isnt bread riz enough when it runs over the pans sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay mrs march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a windingsheet while the dear departed lay in state in the dominobox a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said shed come to dinner now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends so meg gave her the easychair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions criticised everything and told stories of the people whom she knew language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and goodwill is necessary to make a cook she boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever the bread burnt black for the saladdressing so aggravated her that she let everything else go till she had convinced herself that she could not make it fit to eat the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meagre proportions concealed in a grove of lettuceleaves the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at last the blancmange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only its mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread for laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose curious eyes would mark all failures and whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed up her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene jos one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and every one looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily jo who had refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately illustration miss crocker made a wry face oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met lauries eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks so did every one else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gayly with bread and butter olives and fun i havent strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another friends dinnertable they did sober themselves for beths sake laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his tenderhearted mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner here lies pip march who died the 7th of june loved and lamented sore and not forgotten soon at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up pillows and putting things in order meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper mrs march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected till the last minute as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered in the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled what a dreadful day this has been begun jo usually the first to speak it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg not a bit like home added amy it cant seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head heres mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it as she spoke mrs march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun i dont cried jo decidedly nor i echoed the others you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you lounging and larking doesnt pay observed jo shaking her head im tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off suppose you learn plain cooking thats a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of jos dinnerparty for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how wed get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i dont think you were very happy or amiable so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when every one thinks only of herself dont you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all we do mother we do cried the girls then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them work is wholesome and there is plenty for every one it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion well work like bees and love it too see if we dont said jo ill learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the next dinnerparty i have shall be a success ill make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee i can and i will though im not fond of sewing that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said meg ill do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was beths resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only dont go to the other extreme and delve like slaves have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty well remember mother and they did illustration well work like bees xii camp laurence illustration beth was postmistress beth was postmistress for being most at home she could attend to it regularly and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail one july day she came in with her hands full and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post heres your posy mother laurie never forgets that she said putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in marmees corner and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy miss meg march one letter and a glove continued beth delivering the articles to her sister who sat near her mother stitching wristbands why i left a pair over there and here is only one said meg looking at the gray cotton glove didnt you drop the other in the garden no im sure i didnt for there was only one in the office i hate to have odd gloves never mind the other may be found my letter is only a translation of the german song i wanted i think mr brooke did it for this isnt lauries writing mrs march glanced at meg who was looking very pretty in her gingham morninggown with the little curls blowing about her forehead and very womanly as she sat sewing at her little worktable full of tidy white rolls so unconscious of the thought in her mothers mind as she sewed and sung while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt that mrs march smiled and was satisfied two letters for doctor jo a book and a funny old hat which covered the whole postoffice stuck outside said beth laughing as she went into the study where jo sat writing what a sly fellow laurie is i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion because i burn my face every hot day he said why mind the fashion wear a big hat and be comfortable i said i would if i had one and he has sent me this to try me ill wear it for fun and show him i dont care for the fashion and hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of plato jo read her letters one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill for it said to her my dear i write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction i watch your efforts to control your temper you say nothing about your trials failures or successes and think perhaps that no one sees them but the friend whose help you daily ask if i may trust the wellworn cover of your guidebook i too have seen them all and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution since it begins to bear fruit go on dear patiently and bravely and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving mother that does me good thats worth millions of money and pecks of praise o marmee i do try i will keep on trying and not get tired since i have you to help me laying her head on her arms jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good and this assurance was doubly precious doubly encouraging because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon she pinned the note inside her frock as a shield and a reminder lest she be taken unaware and proceeded to open her other letter quite ready for either good or bad news in a big dashing hand laurie wrote dear jo what ho some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and i want to have a jolly time if its fine im going to pitch my tent in longmeadow and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquethave a fire make messes gypsy fashion and all sorts of larks they are nice people and like such things brooke will go to keep us boys steady and kate vaughn will play propriety for the girls i want you all to come cant let beth off at any price and nobody shall worry her dont bother about rationsill see to that and everything elseonly do come theres a good fellow in a tearing hurry yours ever laurie heres richness cried jo flying in to tell the news to meg of course we can go mother it will be such a help to laurie for i can row and meg see to the lunch and the children be useful in some way i hope the vaughns are not fine grownup people do you know anything about them jo asked meg only that there are four of them kate is older than you fred and frank twins about my age and a little girl grace who is nine or ten laurie knew them abroad and liked the boys i fancied from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her that he didnt admire kate much im so glad my french print is clean its just the thing and so becoming observed meg complacently have you anything decent jo scarlet and gray boating suit good enough for me i shall row and tramp about so i dont want any starch to think of youll come bethy if you wont let any of the boys talk to me not a boy i like to please laurie and im not afraid of mr brooke he is so kind but i dont want to play or sing or say anything ill work hard and not trouble any one and youll take care of me jo so ill go thats my good girl you do try to fight off your shyness and i love you for it fighting faults isnt easy as i know and a cheery word kind of gives a lift thank you mother and jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss more precious to mrs march than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth i had a box of chocolate drops and the picture i wanted to copy said amy showing her mail and i got a note from mr laurence asking me to come over and play to him tonight before the lamps are lighted and i shall go added beth whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely now lets fly round and do double duty today so that we can play tomorrow with free minds said jo preparing to replace her pen with a broom when the sun peeped into the girls room early next morning to promise them a fine day he saw a comical sight each had made such preparation for the fte as seemed necessary and proper meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream beth had taken joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation and amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature it was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawingboards therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose to which it was now put this funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun for he burst out with such radiance that jo woke up and roused all her sisters by a hearty laugh at amys ornament illustration amy capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party and soon a lively bustle began in both houses beth who was ready first kept reporting what went on next door and enlivened her sisters toilets by frequent telegrams from the window there goes the man with the tent i see mrs barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket now mr laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock i wish he would go too theres laurie looking like a sailornice boy oh mercy me heres a carriage full of peoplea tall lady a little girl and two dreadful boys one is lame poor thing hes got a crutch laurie didnt tell us that be quick girls its getting late why there is ned moffat i do declare look meg isnt that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping so it is how queer that he should come i thought he was at the mountains there is sallie im glad she got back in time am i all right jo cried meg in a flutter a regular daisy hold up your dress and put your hat straight it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff now then come on o jo you are not going to wear that awful hat its too absurd you shall not make a guy of yourself remonstrated meg as jo tied down with a red ribbon the broadbrimmed oldfashioned leghorn laurie had sent for a joke i just will though for its capitalso shady light and big it will make fun and i dont mind being a guy if im comfortable with that jo marched straight away and the rest followeda bright little band of sisters all looking their best in summer suits with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner the lawn was the receptionroom and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there meg was grateful to see that miss kate though twenty was dressed with a simplicity which american girls would do well to imitate and she was much flattered by mr neds assurances that he came especially to see her jo understood why laurie primmed up his mouth when speaking of kate for that young lady had a standoffdonttouchme air which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not dreadful but gentle and feeble and she would be kind to him on that account amy found grace a wellmannered merry little person and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes they suddenly became very good friends tents lunch and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand the party was soon embarked and the two boats pushed off together leaving mr laurence waving his hat on the shore laurie and jo rowed one boat mr brooke and ned the other while fred vaughn the riotous twin did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed waterbug jos funny hat deserved a vote of thanks for it was of general utility it broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh it created quite a refreshing breeze flapping to and fro as she rowed and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party if a shower came up she said kate looked rather amazed at jos proceedings especially as she exclaimed christopher columbus when she lost her oar and laurie said my dear fellow did i hurt you when he tripped over her feet in taking his place but after putting up her glass to examine the queer girl several times miss kate decided that she was odd but rather clever and smiled upon her from afar illustration mr laurence waving his hat meg in the other boat was delightfully situated face to face with the rowers who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon skill and dexterity mr brooke was a grave silent young man with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopdia of useful knowledge he never talked to her much but he looked at her a good deal and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion ned being in college of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume he was not very wise but very goodnatured and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic sallie gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white piqu dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous fred who kept beth in constant terror by his pranks it was not far to longmeadow but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived a pleasant green field with three widespreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet welcome to camp laurence said the young host as they landed with exclamations of delight brooke is commanderinchief i am commissarygeneral the other fellows are staffofficers and you ladies are company the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawingroom this is the messroom and the third is the campkitchen now lets have a game before it gets hot and then well see about dinner frank beth amy and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight mr brooke chose meg kate and fred laurie took sallie jo and ned the englishers played well but the americans played better and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of 76 inspired them jo and fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke which failure ruffled her a good deal fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers he gave a stroke his ball hit the wicket and stopped an inch on the wrong side no one was very near and running up to examine he gave it a sly nudge with his toe which put it just an inch on the right side im through now miss jo ill settle you and get in first cried the young gentleman swinging his mallet for another blow illustration now miss jo ill settle you you pushed it i saw you its my turn now said jo sharply upon my word i didnt move it it rolled a bit perhaps but that is allowed so stand off please and let me have a go at the stake we dont cheat in america but you can if you choose said jo angrily yankees are a deal the most tricky everybody knows there you go returned fred croqueting her ball far away jo opened her lips to say something rude but checked herself in time colored up to her forehead and stood a minute hammering down a wicket with all her might while fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation she went off to get her ball and was a long time finding it among the bushes but she came back looking cool and quiet and waited her turn patiently it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost and when she got there the other side had nearly won for kates ball was the last but one and lay near the stake by george its all up with us goodby kate miss jo owes me one so you are finished cried fred excitedly as they all drew near to see the finish yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies said jo with a look that made the lad redden especially when they beat them she added as leaving kates ball untouched she won the game by a clever stroke laurie threw up his hat then remembered that it wouldnt do to exult over the defeat of his guests and stopped in the middle of a cheer to whisper to his friend good for you jo he did cheat i saw him we cant tell him so but he wont do it again take my word for it meg drew her aside under pretence of pinning up a loose braid and said approvingly it was dreadfully provoking but you kept your temper and im so glad jo dont praise me meg for i could box his ears this minute i should certainly have boiled over if i hadnt stayed among the nettles till i got my rage under enough to hold my tongue its simmering now so i hope hell keep out of my way returned jo biting her lips as she glowered at fred from under her big hat time for lunch said mr brooke looking at his watch commissarygeneral will you make the fire and get water while miss march miss sallie and i spread the table who can make good coffee jo can said meg glad to recommend her sister so jo feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor went to preside over the coffeepot while the children collected dry sticks and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by miss kate sketched and frank talked to beth who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates the commanderinchief and his aids soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables prettily decorated with green leaves jo announced that the coffee was ready and every one settled themselves to a hearty meal for youth is seldom dyspeptic and exercise develops wholesome appetites a very merry lunch it was for everything seemed fresh and funny and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by there was a pleasing inequality in the table which produced many mishaps to cups and plates acorns dropped into the milk little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on three whiteheaded children peeped over the fence and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main illustration a very merry lunch it waspage 156 theres salt here if you prefer it said laurie as he handed jo a saucer of berries thank you i prefer spiders she replied fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death how dare you remind me of that horrid dinnerparty when yours is so nice in every way added jo as they both laughed and ate out of one plate the china having run short i had an uncommonly good time that day and havent got over it yet this is no credit to me you know i dont do anything its you and meg and brooke who make it go and im no end obliged to you what shall we do when we cant eat any more asked laurie feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over have games till its cooler i brought authors and i dare say miss kate knows something new and nice go and ask her shes company and you ought to stay with her more arent you company too i thought shed suit brooke but he keeps talking to meg and kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers im going so you neednt try to preach propriety for you cant do it jo miss kate did know several new games and as the girls would not and the boys could not eat any more they all adjourned to the drawingroom to play rigmarole one person begins a story any nonsense you like and tells as long as he pleases only taking care to stop short at some exciting point when the next takes it up and does the same its very funny when well done and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over please start it mr brooke said kate with a commanding air which surprised meg who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies mr brooke obediently began the story with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river once on a time a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune for he had nothing but his sword and his shield he travelled a long while nearly eightandtwenty years and had a hard time of it till he came to the palace of a good old king who had offered a reward to any one who would tame and train a fine but unbroken colt of which he was very fond the knight agreed to try and got on slowly but surely for the colt was a gallant fellow and soon learned to love his new master though he was freakish and wild every day when he gave his lessons to this pet of the kings the knight rode him through the city and as he rode he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face which he had seen many times in his dreams but never found one day as he went prancing down a quiet street he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face he was delighted inquired who lived in this old castle and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty the knight wished intensely that he could free them but he was poor and could only go by each day watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them he went and knocked the great door flew open and he beheld illustration he went prancing down a quiet street a ravishingly lovely lady who exclaimed with a cry of rapture at last at last continued kate who had read french novels and admired the style tis she cried count gustave and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy oh rise she said extending a hand of marble fairness never till you tell me how i may rescue you swore the knight still kneeling alas my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed where is the villain in the mauve salon go brave heart and save me from despair i obey and return victorious or dead with these thrilling words he rushed away and flinging open the door of the mauve salon was about to enter when he received illustration oh rise she said a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him said ned instantly sir whatshisname recovered himself pitched the tyrant out of the window and turned to join the lady victorious but with a bump on his brow found the door locked tore up the curtains made a rope ladder got halfway down when the ladder broke and he went head first into the moat sixty feet below could swim like a duck paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts then by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength he smashed in the door went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick toads as big as your fist and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics miss march at the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood illustration a stunning blow from the big greek lexicon a tall figure all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand went on meg it beckoned gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side a dead silence reigned the lamp burned blue and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil they reached a curtained door behind which sounded lovely music he sprang forward to enter but the spectre plucked him back and waved threateningly before him a snuffbox said jo in a sepulchral tone which convulsed the audience thankee said the knight politely as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off ha ha laughed the ghost and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads like sardines who all rose and began to illustration he sneezed dance a hornpipe cut in fred as jo paused for breath and as they danced the rubbishy old castle turned to a manofwar in full sail up with the jib reef the topsl halliards helm hard a lee and man the guns roared the captain as a portuguese pirate hove in sight with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast go in and win my hearties says the captain and a tremendous fight begun of course the british beat they always do no they dont cried jo aside having taken the pirate captain prisoner sailed slap over the schooner whose decks were piled with dead and whose leescuppers ran blood for the order had been cutlasses and die hard bosens mate take a bight of the flyingjib sheet and start this villain if he dont confess his sins double quick said the british captain the portuguese held his tongue like a brick and walked the plank while the jolly tars cheered like mad but the sly dog dived came up under the manofwar scuttled her and down she went with all sail set to the bottom of the sea sea sea where illustration the portuguese walked the plank oh gracious what shall i say cried sallie as fred ended his rigmarole in which he had jumbled together pellmell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books well they went to the bottom and a nice mermaid welcomed them but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights and kindly pickled them in brine hoping to discover the mystery about them for being a woman she was curious by and by a diver came down and the mermaid said ill give you this box of pearls if you can take it up for she wanted to restore the poor things to life and couldnt raise the heavy load herself so the diver hoisted it up and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls he left it in a great lonely field where it was found by a little goosegirl who kept a hundred fat geese in the field said amy when sallies invention gave out the little girl was sorry for them and asked an old woman what she should do to help them your geese will tell you they know everything said the old woman so she asked what she should use for new heads since the old ones were lost and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed cabbages continued laurie promptly just the thing said the girl and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden she put them on the knights revived at once thanked her and went on their way rejoicing never knowing the difference for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it the knight in whom im interested went back to find the pretty face and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone to be married but one he was in a great state of mind at that and mounting the colt who stood by him through thick and thin rushed to the castle to see which was left peeping over the hedge he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden will you give me a rose said he you must come and get it i cant come to you it isnt proper said she as sweet as honey he tried to climb over the hedge but it seemed to grow higher and higher then he tried to push through but it grew thicker and thicker and he was in despair so he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped saying imploringly let me in let me in but the pretty princess did not seem to understand for she picked her roses quietly and left him to fight his way in whether he did or not frank will tell you illustration will you give me a rose i cant im not playing i never do said frank dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple beth had disappeared behind jo and grace was asleep so the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge is he asked mr brooke still watching the river and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole i guess the princess gave him a posy and opened the gate after a while said laurie smiling to himself as he threw acorns at his tutor what a piece of nonsense we have made with practice we might do something quite clever do you know truth asked sallie after they had laughed over their story i hope so said meg soberly the game i mean what is it said fred why you pile up your hands choose a number and draw out in turn and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any questions put by the rest its great fun lets try it said jo who liked new experiments miss kate and mr brooke meg and ned declined but fred sallie jo and laurie piled and drew and the lot fell to laurie who are your heroes asked jo grandfather and napoleon which lady here do you think prettiest said sallie margaret which do you like best from fred jo of course what silly questions you ask and jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at lauries matteroffact tone try again truth isnt a bad game said fred its a very good one for you retorted jo in a low voice her turn came next what is your greatest fault asked fred by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself a quick temper what do you most wish for said laurie a pair of bootlacings returned jo guessing and defeating his purpose not a true answer you must say what you really do want most genius dont you wish you could give it to me laurie and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face what virtues do you most admire in a man asked sallie courage and honesty now my turn said fred as his hand came last lets give it to him whispered laurie to jo who nodded and asked at once didnt you cheat at croquet well yes a little bit good didnt you take your story out of the sealion said laurie rather dont you think the english nation perfect in every respect asked sallie i should be ashamed of myself if i didnt hes a true john bull now miss sallie you shall have a chance without waiting to draw ill harrow up your feelings first by asking if you dont think you are something of a flirt said laurie as jo nodded to fred as a sign that peace was declared you impertinent boy of course im not exclaimed sallie with an air that proved the contrary what do you hate most asked fred spiders and ricepudding what do you like best asked jo dancing and french gloves well i think truth is a very silly play lets have a sensible game of authors to refresh our minds proposed jo ned frank and the little girls joined in this and while it went on the three elders sat apart talking miss kate took out her sketch again and margaret watched her while mr brooke lay on the grass with a book which he did not read how beautifully you do it i wish i could draw said meg with mingled admiration and regret in her voice why dont you learn i should think you had taste and talent for it replied miss kate graciously i havent time your mamma prefers other accomplishments i fancy so did mine but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately and then she was quite willing i should go on cant you do the same with your governess i have none i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us very fine schools they are too papa says you go to a private one i suppose i dont go at all i am a governess myself oh indeed said miss kate but she might as well have said dear me how dreadful for her tone implied it and something in her face made meg color and wish she had not been so frank mr brooke looked up and said quickly young ladies in america love independence as much as their ancestors did and are admired and respected for supporting themselves oh yes of course its very nice and proper in them to do so we have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility because being the daughters of gentlemen they are both wellbred and accomplished you know said miss kate in a patronizing tone that hurt megs pride and made her work seem not only more distasteful but degrading did the german song suit miss march inquired mr brooke breaking an awkward pause oh yes it was very sweet and im much obliged to whoever translated it for me and megs downcast face brightened as she spoke dont you read german asked miss kate with a look of surprise not very well my father who taught me is away and i dont get on very fast alone for ive no one to correct my pronunciation try a little now here is schillers mary stuart and a tutor who loves to teach and mr brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile its so hard im afraid to try said meg grateful but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her ill read a bit to encourage you and miss kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner mr brooke made no comment as she returned the book to meg who said innocently i thought it was poetry some of it is try this passage there was a queer smile about mr brookes mouth as he opened at poor marys lament meg obediently following the long grassblade which her new tutor used to point with read slowly and timidly unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice down the page went the green guide and presently forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene meg read as if alone giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen if she had seen the brown eyes then she would have stopped short but she never looked up and the lesson was not spoiled for her very well indeed said mr brooke as she paused quite ignoring her many mistakes and looking as if he did indeed love to teach miss kate put up her glass and having taken a survey of the little tableau before her shut her sketchbook saying with condescension illustration miss kate put up her glass youve a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader i advise you to learn for german is a valuable accomplishment to teachers i must look after grace she is romping and miss kate strolled away adding to herself with a shrug i didnt come to chaperone a governess though she is young and pretty what odd people these yankees are im afraid laurie will be quite spoilt among them i forgot that english people rather turn up their noses at governesses and dont treat them as we do said meg looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression tutors also have rather a hard time of it there as i know to my sorrow theres no place like america for us workers miss margaret and mr brooke looked so contented and cheerful that meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot im glad i live in it then i dont like my work but i get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all so i wont complain i only wish i liked teaching as you do i think you would if you had laurie for a pupil i shall be very sorry to lose him next year said mr brooke busily punching holes in the turf going to college i suppose megs lips asked that question but her eyes added and what becomes of you yes its high time he went for he is ready and as soon as he is off i shall turn soldier i am needed i am glad of that exclaimed meg i should think every young man would want to go though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home she added sorrowfully i have neither and very few friends to care whether i live or die said mr brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up like a little grave laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you said meg heartily thank you that sounds pleasant began mr brooke looking cheerful again but before he could finish his speech ned mounted on the old horse came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies and there was no more quiet that day dont you love to ride asked grace of amy as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others led by ned i dote upon it my sister meg used to ride when papa was rich but we dont keep any horses now except ellen tree added amy laughing tell me about ellen tree is it a donkey asked grace curiously illustration ellen tree why you see jo is crazy about horses and so am i but weve only got an old sidesaddle and no horse out in our garden is an appletree that has a nice low branch so jo put the saddle on it fixed some reins on the part that turns up and we bounce away on ellen tree whenever we like how funny laughed grace i have a pony at home and ride nearly every day in the park with fred and kate its very nice for my friends go too and the row is full of ladies and gentlemen dear how charming i hope i shall go abroad some day but id rather go to rome than the row said amy who had not the remotest idea what the row was and wouldnt have asked for the world frank sitting just behind the little girls heard what they were saying and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics beth who was collecting the scattered authorcards looked up and said in her shy yet friendly way im afraid you are tired can i do anything for you talk to me please its dull sitting by myself answered frank who had evidently been used to being made much of at home if he had asked her to deliver a latin oration it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth but there was no place to run to no jo to hide behind now and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try what do you like to talk about she asked fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up well i like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting said frank who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength my heart what shall i do i dont know anything about them thought beth and forgetting the boys misfortune in her flurry she said hoping to make him talk i never saw any hunting but i suppose you know all about it i did once but i can never hunt again for i got hurt leaping a confounded fivebarred gate so there are no more horses and hounds for me said frank with a sigh that made beth hate herself for her innocent blunder your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes she said turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys books in which jo delighted buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory and in her eagerness to amuse another beth forgot herself and was quite unconscious of her sisters surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys against whom she had begged protection bless her heart she pities him so she is good to him said jo beaming at her from the croquetground i always said she was a little saint added meg as if there could be no further doubt of it i havent heard frank laugh so much for ever so long said grace to amy as they sat discussing dolls and making teasets out of the acorncups my sister beth is a very fastidious girl when she likes to be said amy well pleased at beths success she meant fascinating but as grace didnt know the exact meaning of either word fastidious sounded well and made a good impression an impromptu circus fox and geese and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon at sunset the tent was struck hampers packed wickets pulled up boats loaded and the whole party floated down the river singing at the tops of their voices ned getting sentimental warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain alone alone ah woe alone and at the lines we each are young we each have a heart oh why should we stand thus coldly apart he looked at meg with such a lackadaisical expression that she laughed outright and spoilt his song how can you be so cruel to me he whispered under cover of a lively chorus youve kept close to that starchedup englishwoman all day and now you snub me i didnt mean to but you looked so funny i really couldnt help it replied meg passing over the first part of his reproach for it was quite true that she had shunned him remembering the moffat party and the talk after it ned was offended and turned to sallie for consolation saying to her rather pettishly there isnt a bit of flirt in that girl is there not a particle but shes a dear returned sallie defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings shes not a stricken deer any way said ned trying to be witty and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do on the lawn where it had gathered the little party separated with cordial goodnights and goodbyes for the vaughns were going to canada as the four sisters went home through the garden miss kate looked after them saying without the patronizing tone in her voice in spite of their demonstrative manners american girls are very nice when one knows them i quite agree with you said mr brooke illustration tailpiece illustration swinging to and fro in his hammock xiii castles in the air laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock one warm september afternoon wondering what his neighbors were about but too lazy to go and find out he was in one of his moods for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory and he was wishing he could live it over again the hot weather made him indolent and he had shirked his studies tried mr brookes patience to the utmost displeased his grandfather by practising half the afternoon frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad and after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself staring up into the green gloom of the horsechestnut trees above him he dreamed dreams of all sorts and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash peeping through the meshes of the hammock he saw the marches coming out as if bound on some expedition what in the world are those girls about now thought laurie opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors each wore a large flapping hat a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder and carried a long staff meg had a cushion jo a book beth a basket and amy a portfolio all walked quietly through the garden out at the little back gate and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river well thats cool said laurie to himself to have a picnic and never ask me they cant be going in the boat for they havent got the key perhaps they forgot it ill take it to them and see whats going on though possessed of half a dozen hats it took him some time to find one then there was a hunt for the key which was at last discovered in his pocket so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them taking the shortest way to the boathouse he waited for them to appear but no one came and he went up the hill to take an observation a grove of pines covered one part of it and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets heres a landscape thought laurie peeping through the bushes and looking wideawake and goodnatured already it was rather a pretty little picture for the sisters sat together in the shady nook with sun and shadow flickering over them the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks and all the little woodpeople going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends meg sat upon her cushion sewing daintily with her white hands and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by for she made pretty things of them amy was sketching a group of ferns and jo was knitting as she read aloud a shadow passed over the boys face as he watched them feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit he stood so still that a squirrel busy with its harvesting ran down a pine close beside him saw him suddenly and skipped back scolding so shrilly that beth looked up espied the wistful face behind the birches and beckoned with a reassuring smile illustration it was rather a pretty little picture may i come in please or shall i be a bother he asked advancing slowly meg lifted her eyebrows but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once of course you may we should have asked you before only we thought you wouldnt care for such a girls game as this i always liked your games but if meg doesnt want me ill go away ive no objection if you do something its against the rules to be idle here replied meg gravely but graciously much obliged ill do anything if youll let me stop a bit for its as dull as the desert of sahara down there shall i sew read cone draw or do all at once bring on your bears im ready and laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold finish this story while i set my heel said jo handing him the book yesm was the meek answer as he began doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of an admission into the busy bee society the story was not a long one and when it was finished he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit please maam could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one would you tell him asked meg of her sisters hell laugh said amy warningly who cares said jo i guess hell like it added beth of course i shall i give you my word i wont laugh tell away jo and dont be afraid the idea of being afraid of you well you see we used to play pilgrims progress and we have been going on with it in earnest all winter and summer yes i know said laurie nodding wisely who told you demanded jo spirits no i did i wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away and he was rather dismal he did like it so dont scold jo said beth meekly you cant keep a secret never mind it saves trouble now go on please said laurie as jo became absorbed in her work looking a trifle displeased oh didnt she tell you about this new plan of ours well we have tried not to waste our holiday but each has had a task and worked at it with a will the vacation is nearly over the stints are all done and we are ever so glad that we didnt dawdle yes i should think so and laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days mother likes to have us out of doors as much as possible so we bring our work here and have nice times for the fun of it we bring our things in these bags wear the old hats use poles to climb the hill and play pilgrims as we used to do years ago we call this hill the delectable mountain for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time jo pointed and laurie sat up to examine for through an opening in the wood one could look across the wide blue river the meadows on the other side far over the outskirts of the great city to the green hills that rose to meet the sky the sun was low and the heavens plowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some celestial city how beautiful that is said laurie softly for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind its often so and we like to watch it for it is never the same but always splendid replied amy wishing she could paint it jo talks about the country where we hope to live some timethe real country she means with pigs and chickens and haymaking it would be nice but i wish the beautiful country up there was real and we could ever go to it said beth musingly there is a lovelier country even than that where we shall go by and by when we are good enough answered meg with her sweet voice it seems so long to wait so hard to do i want to fly away at once as those swallows fly and go in at that splendid gate youll get there beth sooner or later no fear of that said jo im the one that will have to fight and work and climb and wait and maybe never get in after all youll have me for company if thats any comfort i shall have to do a deal of travelling before i come in sight of your celestial city if i arrive late youll say a good word for me wont you beth something in the boys face troubled his little friend but she said cheerfully with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds if people really want to go and really try all their lives i think they will get in for i dont believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate i always imagine it is as it is in the picture where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river wouldnt it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true and we could live in them said jo after a little pause ive made such quantities it would be hard to choose which id have said laurie lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him youd have to take your favorite one what is it asked meg if i tell mine will you tell yours yes if the girls will too we will now laurie after id seen as much of the world as i want to id like to settle in germany and have just as much music as i choose im to be a famous musician myself and all creation is to rush to hear me and im never to be bothered about money or business but just enjoy myself and live for what i like thats my favorite castle whats yours meg margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers and waved a brake before her face as if to disperse imaginary gnats while she said slowly i should like a lovely house full of all sorts of luxurious thingsnice food pretty clothes handsome furniture pleasant people and heaps of money i am to be mistress of it and manage it as i like with plenty of servants so i never need work a bit how i should enjoy it for i wouldnt be idle but do good and make every one love me dearly illustration waved a brake before her face wouldnt you have a master for your castle in the air asked laurie slyly i said pleasant people you know and meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke so that no one saw her face why dont you say youd have a splendid wise good husband and some angelic little children you know your castle wouldnt be perfect without said blunt jo who had no tender fancies yet and rather scorned romance except in books youd have nothing but horses inkstands and novels in yours answered meg petulantly wouldnt i though id have a stable full of arabian steeds rooms piled with books and id write out of a magic inkstand so that my works should be as famous as lauries music i want to do something splendid before i go into my castlesomething heroic or wonderful that wont be forgotten after im dead i dont know what but im on the watch for it and mean to astonish you all some day i think i shall write books and get rich and famous that would suit me so that is my favorite dream mine is to stay at home safe with father and mother and help take care of the family said beth contentedly dont you wish for anything else asked laurie since i had my little piano i am perfectly satisfied i only wish we may all keep well and be together nothing else i have ever so many wishes but the pet one is to be an artist and go to rome and do fine pictures and be the best artist in the whole world was amys modest desire were an ambitious set arent we every one of us but beth wants to be rich and famous and gorgeous in every respect i do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes said laurie chewing grass like a meditative calf ive got the key to my castle in the air but whether i can unlock the door remains to be seen observed jo mysteriously ive got the key to mine but im not allowed to try it hang college muttered laurie with an impatient sigh heres mine and amy waved her pencil i havent got any said meg forlornly yes you have said laurie at once where in your face nonsense thats of no use wait and see if it doesnt bring you something worth having replied the boy laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew meg colored behind the brake but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which mr brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight if we are all alive ten years hence lets meet and see how many of us have got our wishes or how much nearer we are then than now said jo always ready with a plan bless me how old i shall betwentyseven exclaimed meg who felt grown up already having just reached seventeen you and i shall be twentysix teddy beth twentyfour and amy twentytwo what a venerable party said jo i hope i shall have done something to be proud of by that time but im such a lazy dog im afraid i shall dawdle jo you need a motive mother says and when you get it she is sure youll work splendidly is she by jupiter i will if i only get the chance cried laurie sitting up with sudden energy i ought to be satisfied to please grandfather and i do try but its working against the grain you see and comes hard he wants me to be an india merchant as he was and id rather be shot i hate tea and silk and spices and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring and i dont care how soon they go to the bottom when i own them going to college ought to satisfy him for if i give him four years he ought to let me off from the business but hes set and i ve got to do just as he did unless i break away and please myself as my father did if there was any one left to stay with the old gentleman id do it tomorrow laurie spoke excitedly and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation for he was growing up very fast and in spite of his indolent ways had a young mans hatred of subjection a young mans restless longing to try the world for himself i advise you to sail away in one of your ships and never come home again till you have tried your own way said jo whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit and whose sympathy was excited by what she called teddys wrongs thats not right jo you mustnt talk in that way and laurie mustnt take your bad advice you should do just what your grandfather wishes my dear boy said meg in her most maternal tone do your best at college and when he sees that you try to please him im sure he wont be hard or unjust to you as you say there is no one else to stay with and love him and youd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission dont be dismal or fret but do your duty and youll get your reward as good mr brooke has by being respected and loved what do you know about him asked laurie grateful for the good advice but objecting to the lecture and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak only what your grandpa told us about himhow he took good care of his own mother till she died and wouldnt go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldnt leave her and how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother and never tells any one but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be so he is dear old fellow said laurie heartily as meg paused looking flushed and earnest with her story its like grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know and to tell all his goodness to others so that they might like him brooke couldnt understand why your mother was so kind to him asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way he thought she was just perfect and talked about it for days and days and went on about you all in flaming style if ever i do get my wish you see what ill do for brooke begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out said meg sharply how do you know i do miss i can always tell by his face when he goes away if you have been good he looks satisfied and walks briskly if you have plagued him hes sober and walks slowly as if he wanted to go back and do his work better well i like that so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in brookes face do you i see him bow and smile as he passes your window but i didnt know youd got up a telegraph illustration i see him bow and smile we havent dont be angry and oh dont tell him i said anything it was only to show that i cared how you get on and what is said here is said in confidence you know cried meg much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech i dont tell tales replied laurie with his high and mighty air as jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore only if brooke is going to be a thermometer i must mind and have fair weather for him to report please dont be offended i didnt mean to preach or tell tales or be silly i only thought jo was encouraging you in a feeling which youd be sorry for by and by you are so kind to us we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think forgive me i meant it kindly and meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid ashamed of his momentary pique laurie squeezed the kind little hand and said frankly im the one to be forgiven im cross and have been out of sorts all day i like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly so dont mind if i am grumpy sometimes i thank you all the same bent on showing that he was not offended he made himself as agreeable as possiblewound cotton for meg recited poetry to please jo shook down cones for beth and helped amy with her ferns proving himself a fit person to belong to the busy bee society in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea to draw and they would just have time to get home to supper may i come again asked laurie yes if you are good and love your book as the boys in the primer are told to do said meg smiling ill try then you may come and ill teach you to knit as the scotchmen do theres a demand for socks just now added jo waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate that night when beth played to mr laurence in the twilight laurie standing in the shadow of the curtain listened to the little david whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit and watched the old man who sat with his gray head on his hand thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much remembering the conversation of the afternoon the boy said to himself with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully ill let my castle go and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me for i am all he has illustration tailpiece illustration jo was very busy xiv secrets jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming there ive done my best if this wont suit i shall have to wait till i can do better lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how earnest her work had been jos desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall in it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly down stairs leaving her friends to nibble her pens and taste her ink she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious if any one had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this manuvre she repeated several times to the great amusement of a blackeyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out there was a dentists sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver its like her to come alone but if she has a bad time shell need some one to help her home in ten minutes jo came running down stairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time not very you got through quickly yes thank goodness why did you go alone didnt want any one to know youre the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon begging your pardon maam it wasnt a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing im glad of that why you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and well make a fine thing of the fencing scene laurie burst out with a hearty boys laugh which made several passersby smile in spite of themselves ill teach you whether we play hamlet or not its grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i dont believe that was your only reason for saying im glad in that decided way was it now no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you not often i wish you wouldnt its no harm jo i have billiards at home but its no fun unless you have good players so as im fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows oh dear im so sorry for youll get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope youd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head cant a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled that depends upon how and where he takes it i dont like ned and his set and wish youd keep out of it mother wont let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she wont be willing to have us frolic together as we do now wont she asked laurie anxiously no she cant bear fashionable young men and shed shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them well she neednt get out her bandboxes yet im not a fashionable party and dont mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then dont you yes nobody minds them so lark away but dont get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times ill be a doubledistilled saint i cant bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and well never desert you i dont know what i should do if you acted like mr kings son he had plenty of money but didnt know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his fathers name i believe and was altogether horrid you think im likely to do the same much obliged no i dontoh dear nobut i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i shouldnt worry then do you worry about me jo a little when you look moody or discontented as you sometimes do for youve got such a strong will if you once get started wrong im afraid it would be hard to stop you laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips still smiled as if at her warnings are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently of course not why because if you are ill take a bus if you are not id like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting i wont preach any more and id like to hear the news immensely very well then come on its a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours i havent got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had you know you haveyou cant hide anything so up and fess or i wont tell cried laurie is your secret a nice one oh isnt it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and ive been aching to tell it this long time come you begin youll not say anything about it at home will you not a word and you wont tease me in private i never tease yes you do you get everything you want out of people i dont know how you do it but you are a born wheedler thank you fire away well ive left two stories with a newspaper man and hes to give his answer next week whispered jo in her confidants ear hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now illustration hurrah for miss march hush it wont come to anything i dare say but i couldnt rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i didnt want any one else to be disappointed it wont fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day wont it be fun to see them in print and shant we feel proud of our authoress jos eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a friends praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs wheres your secret play fair teddy or ill never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement i may get into a scrape for telling but i didnt promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till ive told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where megs glove is is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence its quite enough for the present as youll agree when i tell you where it is tell then laurie bent and whispered three words in jos ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know saw it where pocket all this time yes isnt that romantic no its horrid dont you like it of course i dont its ridiculous it wont be allowed my patience what would meg say you are not to tell any one mind that i didnt promise that was understood and i trusted you well i wont for the present any way but im disgusted and wish you hadnt told me i thought youd be pleased at the idea of anybody coming to take meg away no thank you youll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away id like to see any one try it cried jo fiercely so should i and laurie chuckled at the idea i dont think secrets agree with me i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said jo rather ungratefully race down this hill with me and youll be all right suggested laurie no one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his atalanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face illustration jo darted away i wish i was a horse then i could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath it was capital but see what a guy its made me go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said jo dropping down under a mapletree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again but some one did pass and who should it be but meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls what in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her dishevelled sister with wellbred surprise getting leaves meekly answered jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up and hairpins added laurie throwing half a dozen into jos lap they grow on this road meg so do combs and brown straw hats you have been running jo how could you when will you stop such romping ways said meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties never till im stiff and old and have to use a crutch dont try to make me grow up before my time meg its hard enough to have you change all of a sudden let me be a little girl as long as i can as she spoke jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that margaret was fast getting to be a woman and lauries secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near he saw the trouble in her face and drew megs attention from it by asking quickly where have you been calling all so fine at the gardiners and sallie has been telling me all about belle moffats wedding it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris just think how delightful that must be do you envy her meg said laurie im afraid i do im glad of it muttered jo tying on her hat with a jerk why asked meg looking surprised because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said jo frowning at laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said i shall never go and marry any one observed meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on for a week or two jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered she rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to mr brooke whenever they met would sit looking at meg with a woebegone face occasionally jumping up to shake and then to kiss her in a very mysterious manner laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about spread eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits on the second saturday after jo got out of the window meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in amys bower what went on there meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers what shall we do with that girl she never will behave like a young lady sighed meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face i hope she wont she is so funny and dear as she is said beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at jos having secrets with any one but her its very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming waytwo agreeable things which made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike in a few minutes jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read illustration jo laid herself on the sofa and affected to read have you anything interesting there asked meg with condescension nothing but a story wont amount to much i guess returned jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight youd better read it aloud that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said amy in her most grownup tone whats the name asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet the rival painters that sounds well read it said meg with a loud hem and a long breath jo began to read very fast the girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end i like that about the splendid picture was amys approving remark as jo paused i prefer the lovering part viola and angelo are two of our favorite names isnt that queer said meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical who wrote it asked beth who had caught a glimpse of jos face the reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice your sister you cried meg dropping her work its very good said amy critically i knew it i knew it o my jo i am so proud and beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg wouldnt believe it till she saw the words miss josephine march actually printed in the paper how graciously amy criticised the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately couldnt be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead how beth got excited and skipped and sung with joy how hannah came in to exclaim sakes alive well i never in great astonishment at that jos doins how proud mrs march was when she knew it how jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how the spread eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the house of march as the paper passed from hand to hand tell us all about it when did it come how much did you get for it what will father say wont laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about jo for these foolish affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy stop jabbering girls and ill tell you everything said jo wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evelina than she did over her rival painters having told how she disposed of her tales jo added and when i went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but didnt pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories it was good practice he said and when the beginners improved any one would pay so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him and he said it was good and i shall write more and hes going to get the next paid for and i am so happy for in time i may be able to support myself and help the girls jos breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end xv a telegram illustration november is the most disagreeable month in the year november is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden thats the reason i was born in it observed jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose if something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said beth who took a hopeful view of everything even november i dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said meg who was out of sorts we go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun we might as well be in a treadmill my patience how blue we are cried jo i dont much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out oh dont i wish i could manage things for you as i do for my heroines youre pretty enough and good enough already so id have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly then youd dash out as an heiress scorn every one who has slighted you go abroad and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance people dont have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women to marry for money its a dreadfully unjust world said meg bitterly jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all just wait ten years and see if we dont said amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces cant wait and im afraid i havent much faith in ink and dirt though im grateful for your good intentions meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but amy spatted away energetically and beth who sat at the other window said smiling two pleasant things are going to happen right away marmee is coming down the street and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell in they both came mrs march with her usual question any letter from father girls and laurie to say in his persuasive way wont some of you come for a drive ive been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and im going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn its a dull day but the air isnt bad and im going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it isnt out come jo you and beth will go wont you of course we will much obliged but im busy and meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive often with the young gentleman we three will be ready in a minute cried amy running away to wash her hands can i do anything for you madam mother asked laurie leaning over mrs marchs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her no thank you except call at the office if youll be so kind dear its our day for a letter and the postman hasnt been father is as regular as the sun but theres some delay on the way perhaps a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter its one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handing it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage illustration one of them horrid telegraph things at the word telegraph mrs march snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart laurie dashed down stairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice mrs march your husband is very ill come at once s hale blank hospital washington how still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them mrs march was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot i shall go at once but it may be too late o children children help me to bear it for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears poor hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was the panacea for most afflictions the lord keep the dear man i wont waste no time a cryin but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one shes right theres no time for tears now be calm girls and let me think they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them wheres laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done here maam oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see send a telegram saying i will come at once the next train goes early in the morning ill take that what else the horses are ready i can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth leave a note at aunt marchs jo give me that pen and paper tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father now go dear but dont kill yourself driving at a desperate pace there is no need of that mrs marchs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life jo run to the rooms and tell mrs king that i cant come on the way get these things ill put them down theyll be needed and i must go prepared for nursing hospital stores are not always good beth go and ask mr laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine im not too proud to beg for father he shall have the best of everything amy tell hannah to get down the black trunk and meg come and help me find my things for im half bewildered writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work every one scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell mr laurence came hurrying back with beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mothers absence which comforted her very much there was nothing he didnt offer from his own dressinggown to himself as escort but that last was impossible mrs march would not hear of the old gentlemans undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for travelling he saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying hed be back directly no one had time to think of him again till as meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon mr brooke illustration she came suddenly upon mr brooke im very sorry to hear of this miss march he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit i came to offer myself as escort to your mother mr laurence has commissions for me in washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that mr brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to make how kind you all are mother will accept im sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has some one to take care of her thank you very very much meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said beforethat she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice next time mrs march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there the short afternoon wore away all the other errands were done and meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while beth and amy got tea and hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still jo did not come they began to get anxious and laurie went off to find her for no one ever knew what freak jo might take into her head he missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice thats my contribution towards making father comfortable and bringing him home my dear where did you get it twentyfive dollars jo i hope you havent done anything rash no its mine honestly i didnt beg borrow or steal it i earned it and i dont think youll blame me for i only sold what was my own as she spoke jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short your hair your beautiful hair o jo how could you your one beauty my dear girl there was no need of this she doesnt look like my jo any more but i love her dearly for it as every one exclaimed and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive any one a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it it doesnt affect the fate of the nation so dont wail beth it will be good for my vanity i was getting too proud of my wig it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off my head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said i could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order im satisfied so please take the money and lets have supper tell me all about it jo i am not quite satisfied but i cant blame you for i know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love but my dear it was not necessary and im afraid you will regret it one of these days said mrs march no i wont returned jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned what made you do it asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair well i was wild to do something for father replied jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble i hate to borrow as much as mother does and i knew aunt march would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it you neednt feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs march with a look that warmed jos heart i hadnt the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if id like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself in a barbers window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars it came over me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine i dont see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair he rather stared at first as if he wasnt used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair he said he didnt care about mine it wasnt the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place the work put into it made it dear and so on it was getting late and i was afraid if it wasnt done right away that i shouldnt have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry it was silly i dare say but it changed his mind for i got rather excited and told the story in my topsyturvy way and his wife heard and said so kindly take it thomas and oblige the young lady id do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling who was jimmy asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along her son she said who was in the army how friendly such things make strangers feel dont they she talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely illustration the man clipped didnt you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked meg with a shiver i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it i never snivel over trifles like that i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends on my head it almost seemed as if id an arm or a leg off the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep ill give it to you marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable i dont think i shall ever have a mane again mrs march folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk she only said thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about mr brookes kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed no one wanted to go to bed when at ten oclock mrs march put by the last finished job and said come girls beth went to the piano and played the fathers favorite hymn all began bravely but broke down one by one till beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler go to bed and dont talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get goodnight my darlings said mrs march as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek jo dear what is it are you crying about father no not now what then mymy hair burst out poor jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow it did not sound at all comical to meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner im not sorry protested jo with a choke id do it again tomorrow if i could its only the vain selfish part of me that goes and cries in this silly way dont tell any one its all over now i thought you were asleep so i just made a little private moan for my one beauty how came you to be awake i cant sleep im so anxious said meg think about something pleasant and youll soon drop off i tried it but felt wider awake than ever what did you think of handsome faceseyes particularly answered meg smiling to herself in the dark what color do you like best brownthat is sometimes blue are lovely jo laughed and meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air the clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlid here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter as she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence be comforted dear soul there is always light behind the clouds illustration tailpiece illustration letters xvi letters in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodby cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them everything seemed very strange when they went downso dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even hannahs familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on the big trunk stood ready in the hall mothers cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution megs eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once and the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag children i leave you to hannahs care and mr laurences protection hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly dont grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless yes mother meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr laurence be patient jo dont get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer us all beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home we will mother we will the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr greatheart on the spot goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie illustration she rolled away how kind every one is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young mans face i dont see how they can help it returned mr brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs march could not help smiling and so the long journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicelymended hose which lay on mothers table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot now my dear young ladies remember what your ma said and dont fret come and have a cup of coffee all round and then lets fall to work and be a credit to the family coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffeepot they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again hope and keep busy thats the motto for us so lets see who will remember it best i shall go to aunt march as usual oh wont she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit i shall go to my kings though id much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she hadnt made her eyes so red no need of that beth and i can keep house perfectly well put in amy with an important air hannah will tell us what to do and well have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dishtub without delay i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively the girls couldnt help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugarbowl the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mothers face it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin thats so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face goodby meggy i hope the kings wont train today dont fret about father dear she added as they parted and i hope aunt march wont croak your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall sisters shoulders thats my only comfort and touching her hat la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good mr brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the despatches which grew more and more cheering as the week passed at first every one was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letterbox by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them my dearest mother it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we couldnt help laughing and crying over it how very kind mr brooke is and how fortunate that mr laurences business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father the girls are all as good as gold jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs i should be afraid she might overdo if i didnt know that her moral fit wouldnt last long beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her she does her own hair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come mr laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away hannah is a perfect saint she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own meg this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curlytailed letters my precious marmee three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say im glad im glad didnt that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for every one is so desperately good its like living in a nest of turtledoves youd laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish she gets prettier every day and im in love with her sometimes the children are regular archangels and iwell im jo and never shall be anything else oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended i was right but didnt speak as i ought and he marched home saying he wouldnt come again till i begged pardon i declared i wouldnt and got mad it lasted all day i felt bad and wanted you very much laurie and i are both so proud its hard to beg pardon but i thought hed come to it for i was in the right he didnt come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry i met him at the gate coming for the same thing we both laughed begged each others pardon and felt all good and comfortable again i made a pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him give him the lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your topsyturvy jo a song from the suds queen of my tub i merrily sing while the white foam rises high and sturdily wash and rinse and wring and fasten the clothes to dry then out in the free fresh air they swing under the sunny sky i wish we could wash from our hearts and souls the stains of the week away and let water and air by their magic make ourselves as pure as they then on the earth there would be indeed a glorious washingday along the path of a useful life will heartsease ever bloom the busy mind has no time to think of sorrow or care or gloom and anxious thoughts may be swept away as we bravely wield a broom i am glad a task to me is given to labor at day by day for it brings me health and strength and hope and i cheerfully learn to say head you may think heart you may feel but hand you shall work alway dear mother there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with fathers tune i cant sing land of the leal now it makes me cry every one is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop i didnt forget to cover the holders and i wind the clock and air the rooms every day

friend and servant james laurence illustration tailpiece xvii little faithful for a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood it was really amazing for every one seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and selfdenial was all the fashion relieved of their first anxiety about their father the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into the old ways they did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for aunt march didnt like to hear people read with colds in their heads jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the washington despatches over and over beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving all the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone avisiting when her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears for father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a certain dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but every one felt how sweet and helpful beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise so they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret meg i wish youd go and see the hummels you know mother told us not to forget them said beth ten days after mrs marchs departure im too tired to go this afternoon replied meg rocking comfortably as she sewed cant you jo asked beth too stormy for me with my cold i thought it was almost well its well enough for me to go out with laurie but not well enough to go to the hummels said jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency why dont you go yourself asked meg i have been every day but the baby is sick and i dont know what to do for it mrs hummel goes away to work and lottchen takes care of it but it gets sicker and sicker and i think you or hannah ought to go beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow ask hannah for some nice little mess and take it round beth the air will do you good said jo adding apologetically id go but i want to finish my writing my head aches and im tired so i thought may be some of you would go said beth amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested meg well ill rest a little and wait for her so beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the hummels were forgotten an hour passed amy did not come meg went to her room to try on a new dress jo was absorbed in her story and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mothers room half an hour after jo went to mothers closet for something and there found beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphorbottle in her hand christopher columbus whats the matter cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly youve had the scarlet fever havent you years ago when meg did why then ill tell you oh jo the babys dead what baby mrs hummels it died in my lap before she got home cried beth with a sob my poor dear how dreadful for you i ought to have gone said jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mothers big chair with a remorseful face it wasnt dreadful jo only so sad i saw in a minute that it was sicker but lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so i took baby and let lotty rest it seemed asleep but all of a sudden it gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still i tried to warm its feet and lotty gave it some milk but it didnt stir and i knew it was dead illustration it didnt stir and i knew it was dead dont cry dear what did you do i just sat and held it softly till mrs hummel came with the doctor he said it was dead and looked at heinrich and minna who have got sore throats scarlet fever maam ought to have called me before he said crossly mrs hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay he smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and i cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or id have the fever no you wont cried jo hugging her close with a frightened look o beth if you should be sick i never could forgive myself what shall we do dont be frightened i guess i shant have it badly i looked in mothers book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so i did take some belladonna and i feel better said beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well if mother was only at home exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off she read a page looked at beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely youve been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so im afraid you are going to have it beth ill call hannah she knows all about sickness dont let amy come she never had it and i should hate to give it to her cant you and meg have it over again asked beth anxiously i guess not dont care if i do serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered jo as she went to consult hannah the good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring jo that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody diedall of which jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg now ill tell you what well do said hannah when she had examined and questioned beth we will have dr bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right then well send amy off to aunt marchs for a spell to keep her out of harms way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse beth for a day or two i shall stay of course im oldest began meg looking anxious and selfreproachful i shall because its my fault she is sick i told mother id do the errands and i havent said jo decidedly which will you have beth there aint no need of but one said hannah jo please and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point ill go and tell amy said meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and jo did amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain amy protested that she would not go and meg left her in despair to ask hannah what should be done before she came back laurie walked into the parlor to find amy sobbing with her head in the sofacushions she told her story expecting to be consoled but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone now be a sensible little woman and do as they say no dont cry but hear what a jolly plan ive got you go to aunt marchs and ill come and take you out every day driving or walking and well have capital times wont that be better than moping here illustration he sat down beside her i dont wish to be sent off as if i was in the way began amy in an injured voice bless your heart child its to keep you well you dont want to be sick do you no im sure i dont but i dare say i shall be for ive been with beth all the time thats the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly i advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss but its dull at aunt marchs and she is so cross said amy looking rather frightened it wont be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how beth is and take you out gallivanting the old lady likes me and ill be as sweet as possible to her so she wont peck at us whatever we do will you take me out in the trotting wagon with puck on my honor as a gentleman and come every single day see if i dont and bring me back the minute beth is well the identical minute and go to the theatre truly a dozen theatres if we may welli guessi will said amy slowly good girl call meg and tell her youll give in said laurie with an approving pat which annoyed amy more than the giving in meg and jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and amy feeling very precious and selfsacrificing promised to go if the doctor said beth was going to be ill how is the little dear asked laurie for beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show she is lying down on mothers bed and feels better the babys death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered meg what a trying world it is said jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful sort of way no sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another there doesnt seem to be anything to hold on to when mothers gone so im all at sea well dont make a porcupine of yourself it isnt becoming settle your wig jo and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friends one beauty that is what troubles me said meg i think we ought to tell her if beth is really ill but hannah says we mustnt for mother cant leave father and it will only make them anxious beth wont be sick long and hannah knows just what to do and mother said we were to mind her so i suppose we must but it doesnt seem quite right to me hum well i cant say suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been we will jo go and get dr bangs at once commanded meg we cant decide anything till he has been stay where you are jo im errandboy to this establishment said laurie taking up his cap im afraid you are busy began meg no ive done my lessons for the day do you study in vacation time asked jo i follow the good example my neighbors set me was lauries answer as he swung himself out of the room i have great hopes of my boy observed jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile he does very wellfor a boy was megs somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her dr bangs came said beth had symptoms of the fever but thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the hummel story amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with jo and laurie as escort aunt march received them with her usual hospitality what do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out illustration what do you want now go away no boys allowed here laurie retired to the window and jo told her story no more than i expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks amy can stay and make herself useful if she isnt sick which ive no doubt she will belooks like it now dont cry child it worries me to hear people sniff amy was on the point of crying but laurie slyly pulled the parrots tail which caused polly to utter an astonished croak and call out bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead what do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly father is much better replied jo trying to keep sober oh is he well that wont last long i fancy march never had any stamina was the cheerful reply ha ha never say die take a pinch of snuff good by good by squalled polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old ladys cap as laurie tweaked him in the rear hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird and jo youd better go at once it isnt proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech i dont think i can bear it but ill try thought amy as she was left alone with aunt march get along you fright screamed polly and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff xviii dark days illustration beth did have the fever beth did have the fever and was much sicker than any one but hannah and the doctor suspected the girls knew nothing about illness and mr laurence was not allowed to see her so hannah had everything all her own way and busy dr bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse meg stayed at home lest she should infect the kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of beths illness she could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind hannah and hannah wouldnt hear of mrs march bein told and worried just for sech a trifle jo devoted herself to beth day and night not a hard task for beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself but there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces round her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother then jo grew frightened meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet a letter from washington added to their trouble for mr march had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while how dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home then it was that margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buyin love protection peace and health the real blessings of life then it was that jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of beths nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of beths unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by the exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty and amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr laurence locked the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him every one missed beth the milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor mrs hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little beth had made meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protg she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo she sent loving messages to amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that father might not think she had neglected him but soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment dr bangs came twice a day hannah sat up at night meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and jo never stirred from beths side the first of december was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death when dr bangs came that morning he looked long at beth held the hot hand in both his own a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low tone to hannah if mrs march can leave her husband shed better be sent for hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and jo after standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm she was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak laurie came in with a letter saying that mr march was mending again jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that laurie asked quickly what is it is beth worse ive sent for mother said jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragical expression good for you jo did you do it on your own responsibility asked laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook no the doctor told us to o jo its not so bad as that cried laurie with a startled face yes it is she doesnt know us she doesnt even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vineleaves on the wall she doesnt look like my beth and theres nobody to help us bear it mother and father both gone and god seems so far away i cant find him as the tears streamed fast down poor jos cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat im here hold on to me jo dear she could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do it was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face illustration gently stroking her head as her mother used to do thank you teddy im better now i dont feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes keep hoping for the best that will help you jo soon your mother will be here and then everything will be right im so glad father is better now she wont feel so bad about leaving him oh me it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry doesnt meg pull fair asked laurie looking indignant oh yes she tries to but she cant love bethy as i do and she wont miss her as i shall beth is my conscience and i cant give her up i cant i cant down went jos face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips it might be unmanly but he couldnt help it and i am glad of it presently as jos sobs quieted he said hopefully i dont think she will die shes so good and we all love her so much i dont believe god will take her away yet the good and dear people always do die groaned jo but she stopped crying for her friends words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears poor girl youre worn out it isnt like you to be forlorn stop a bit ill hearten you up in a jiffy laurie went off two stairs at a time and jo laid her wearied head down on beths little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it it must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely i drinkhealth to my beth you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend how can i ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind ill send in my bill by and by and tonight ill give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something what is it cried jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder i telegraphed to your mother yesterday and brooke answered shed come at once and shell be here tonight and everything will be all right arent you glad i did it laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming beth jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry o laurie o mother i am so glad she did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind he patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought jo round at once holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly oh dont i didnt mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldnt help flying at you tell me all about it and dont give me wine again it makes me act so i dont mind laughed laurie as he settled his tie why you see i got fidgety and so did grandpa we thought hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know shed never forgive us if bethwell if anything happened you know so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off i pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram i never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and i did it your mother will come i know and the late train is in at two am i shall go for her and youve only got to bottle up your rapture and keep beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here laurie youre an angel how shall i ever thank you fly at me again i rather like it said laurie looking mischievousa thing he had not done for a fortnight no thank you ill do it by proxy when your grandpa comes dont tease but go home and rest for youll be up half the night bless you teddy bless you jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her speech she vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while laurie departed feeling that he had made rather a neat thing of it thats the interferingest chap i ever see but i forgive him and do hope mrs march is coming on right away said hannah with an air of relief when jo told the good news meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while jo set the sickroom in order and hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms everything appeared to feel the hopeful change beths bird began to chirp again and a halfblown rose was discovered on amys bush in the window the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly mothers coming dear mothers coming every one rejoiced but beth she lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger it was a piteous sightthe once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty wellkept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow all day she lay so only rousing now and then to mutter water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word all day jo and meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in god and mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by but night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the beds foot and fell fast asleep mr laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than mrs marchs anxious countenance as she entered laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear the girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly if god spares beth ill try to love and serve him all my life answered jo with equal fervor i wish i had no heart it aches so sighed meg after a pause if life is often as hard as this i dont see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face the house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed an hour went by and nothing happened except lauries quiet departure for the station another hourstill no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at washington haunted the poor girls it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its windingsheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their mothers easychair with her face hidden a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo as she thought beth is dead and meg is afraid to tell me she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place the fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered goodby my beth goodby as if waked by the stir hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath the fevers turned shes sleepin natral her skins damp and she breathes easy praise be given oh my goodness me before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane see said meg coming up with a white halfopened rose i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in beths hand tomorrow if shewent away from us but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and mothers face never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done it looks like a fairy world said meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight hark cried jo starting to her feet yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from hannah and then lauries voice saying in a joyful whisper girls shes come shes come illustration amys will xix amys will while these things were happening at home amy was having hard times at aunt marchs she felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home aunt march never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the wellbehaved little girl pleased her very much and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her nephews children though she didnt think proper to confess it she really did her best to make amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with childrens little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way but aunt march had not this gift and she worried amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence so she took amy in hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years agoa process which carried dismay to amys soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider illustration polish up the spoons and the fat silver teapot she had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the oldfashioned spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was not a speck escaped aunt marchs eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit then polly must be fed the lapdog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair after these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and didnt she enjoy it laurie came every day and wheedled aunt march till amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page then patchwork or towels appeared and amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime the evenings were the worst of all for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to bed intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two if it had not been for laurie and old esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible he pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made mop bark by pecking at him while madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like a reprehensible old bird then she could not endure the doga fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day the cook was badtempered the old coachman deaf and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady illustration on his back with all his legs in the air esther was a frenchwoman who had lived with madame as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her her real name was estelle but aunt march ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion she took a fancy to mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in france when amy sat with her while she got up madames laces she also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for aunt march hoarded like a magpie amys chief delight was an indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique to examine and arrange these things gave amy great satisfaction especially the jewelcases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her weddingday her lovers diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn uncle marchs big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay aunt marchs weddingring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all illustration i should choose this which would mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked esther who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables i like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and im fond of necklaces they are so becoming i should choose this if i might replied amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same i too covet that but not as a necklace ah no to me it is a rosary and as such i should use it like a good catholic said esther eying the handsome thing wistfully is it meant to use as you use the string of goodsmelling wooden beads hanging over your glass asked amy truly yes to pray with it would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied i wish i could if mademoiselle was a catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom i served before madame she had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble would it be right for me to do so too asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it it would be excellent and charming and i shall gladly arrange the little dressingroom for you if you like it say nothing to madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear god to preserve your sister esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good i wish i knew where all these pretty things would go when aunt march dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewelcases one by one to you and your sisters i know it madame confides in me i witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered esther smiling how nice but i wish shed let us have them now procrastination is not agreeable observed amy taking a last look at the diamonds it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things the first one who is affianced will have the pearlsmadame has said it and i have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for madame approves your good behavior and charming manners do you think so oh ill be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring its ever so much prettier than kitty bryants i do like aunt march after all and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it from that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the shutup rooms she thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that madame would never know it nor care if she did it was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and amys beautyloving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother while tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart on the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear god to preserve her sister esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for protestant prayers the little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe homenest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children she missed her mothers help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly but amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it in her first effort at being very very good she decided to make her will as aunt march had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided it cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old ladys jewels during one of her playhours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from esther as to certain legal terms and when the goodnatured frenchwoman had signed her name amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie whom she wanted as a second witness as it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took polly with her for company in this room there was a wardrobe full of oldfashioned costumes with which esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately courtesies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears so busy was she on this day that she did not hear lauries ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat she was obliged to walk carefully for she had on highheeled shoes and as laurie told jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with polly sidling and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim aint we fine get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha ha illustration gravely promenaded to and fro having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty laurie tapped and was graciously received sit down and rest while i put these things away then i want to consult you about a very serious matter said amy when she had shown her splendor and driven polly into a corner that bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while laurie seated himself astride of a chair yesterday when aunt was asleep and i was trying to be as still as a mouse polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so i went to let him out and found a big spider there i poked it out and it ran under the bookcase polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye come out and take a walk my dear i couldnt help laughing which made poll swear and aunt woke up and scolded us both did the spider accept the old fellows invitation asked laurie yawning yes out it came and away ran polly frightened to death and scrambled up on aunts chair calling out catch her catch her catch her as i chased the spider thats a lie oh lor cried the parrot pecking at lauries toes id wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked allyluyer bless your buttons dear now im ready said amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a paper out of her pocket i want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right i felt that i ought to do it for life is uncertain and i dont want any illfeeling over my tomb illustration amys will laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling my last will and testiment i amy curtis march being in my sane mind do give and

testiment i set my hand and seal on this 20th day of nov anni domino 1861 amy curtis march estelle valnor witnesses theodore laurence the last name was written in pencil and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly what put it into your head did any one tell you about beths giving away her things asked laurie soberly as amy laid a bit of red tape with sealingwax a taper and a standish before him she explained and then asked anxiously what about beth im sorry i spoke but as i did ill tell you she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa she never thought of a will laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper amys face was full of trouble but she only said dont people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes yes codicils they call them put one in mine thenthat i wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends i forgot it but i want it done though it will spoil my looks laurie added it smiling at amys last and greatest sacrifice then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials but when he came to go amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips is there really any danger about beth im afraid there is but we must hope for the best so dont cry dear and laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting when he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister illustration tailpiece illustration mrs march would not leave beths side xx confidential i dont think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters such hours are beautiful to live but very hard to describe so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness and that megs tender hope was realized for when beth woke from that long healing sleep the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and mothers face too weak to wonder at anything she only smiled and nestled close into the loving arms about her feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last then she slept again and the girls waited upon their mother for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep hannah had dished up an astonishing breakfast for the traveller finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way and meg and jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks while they listened to her whispered account of fathers state mr brookes promise to stay and nurse him the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey and the unspeakable comfort lauries hopeful face had given her when she arrived worn out with fatigue anxiety and cold what a strange yet pleasant day that was so brilliant and gay without for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow so quiet and reposeful within for every one slept spent with watching and a sabbath stillness reigned through the house while nodding hannah mounted guard at the door with a blissful sense of burdens lifted off meg and jo closed their weary eyes and lay at rest like stormbeaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor mrs march would not leave beths side but rested in the big chair waking often to look at touch and brood over her child like a miser over some recovered treasure laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort amy and told his story so well that aunt march actually sniffed herself and never once said i told you so amy came out so strong on this occasion that i think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit she dried her tears quickly restrained her impatience to see her mother and never even thought of the turquoise ring when the old lady heartily agreed in lauries opinion that she behaved like a capital little woman even polly seemed impressed for he called her good girl blessed her buttons and begged her to come and take a walk dear in his most affable tone she would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather but discovering that laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact she persuaded him to rest on the sofa while she wrote a note to her mother she was a long time about it and when she returned he was stretched out with both arms under his head sound asleep while aunt march had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity after a while they began to think he was not going to wake till night and im not sure that he would had he not been effectually roused by amys cry of joy at sight of her mother there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all when she sat in her mothers lap and told her trials receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses they were alone together in the chapel to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her on the contrary i like it very much dear looking from the dusty rosary to the wellworn little book and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet when things vex or grieve us there are a good many hard times in this life of ours but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way i think my little girl is learning this yes mother and when i go home i mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which ive tried to make the womans face is not goodits too beautiful for me to drawbut the baby is done better and i love it very much i like to think he was a little child once for then i dont seem so far away and that helps me as amy pointed to the smiling christchild on his mothers knee mrs march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile she said nothing but amy understood the look and after a minutes pause she added gravely i wanted to speak to you about this but i forgot it aunt gave me the ring today she called me to her and kissed me and put it on my finger and said i was a credit to her and shed like to keep me always she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on as its too big id like to wear them mother can i they are very pretty but i think youre rather too young for such ornaments amy said mrs march looking at the plump little hand with the band of skyblue stones on the forefinger and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together ill try not to be vain said amy i dont think i like it only because its so pretty but i want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet to remind me of something do you mean aunt march asked her mother laughing no to remind me not to be selfish amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing and listened respectfully to the little plan ive thought a great deal lately about my bundle of naughties and being selfish is the largest one in it so im going to try hard to cure it if i can beth isnt selfish and thats the reason every one loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her people wouldnt feel half so bad about me if i was sick and i dont deserve to have them but id like to be loved and missed by a great many friends so im going to try and be like beth all i can im apt to forget my resolutions but if i had something always about me to remind me i guess i should do better may i try this way yes but i have more faith in the corner of the big closet wear your ring dear and do your best i think you will prosper for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle now i must go back to beth keep up your heart little daughter and we will soon have you home again that evening while meg was writing to her father to report the travellers safe arrival jo slipped up stairs into beths room and finding her mother in her usual place stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair with a worried gesture and an undecided look what is it deary asked mrs march holding out her hand with a face which invited confidence i want to tell you something mother about meg how quickly you guessed yes its about her and though its a little thing it fidgets me beth is asleep speak low and tell me all about it that moffat hasnt been here i hope asked mrs march rather sharply no i should have shut the door in his face if he had said jo settling herself on the floor at her mothers feet last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences and only one was returned we forgot all about it till teddy told me that mr brooke had it he kept it in his waistcoat pocket and once it fell out and teddy joked him about it and mr brooke owned that he liked meg but didnt dare say so she was so young and he so poor now isnt it a dreadful state of things do you think meg cares for him asked mrs march with an anxious look mercy me i dont know anything about love and such nonsense cried jo with a funny mixture of interest and contempt in novels the girls show it by starting and blushing fainting away growing thin and acting like fools now meg does not do anything of the sort she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers i forbid him to do it but he doesnt mind me as he ought then you fancy that meg is not interested in john who cried jo staring mr brooke i call him john now we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital and he likes it oh dear i know youll take his part hes been good to father and you wont send him away but let meg marry him if she wants to mean thing to go petting papa and helping you just to wheedle you into liking him and jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak my dear dont get angry about it and i will tell you how it happened john went with me at mr laurences request and was so devoted to poor father that we couldnt help getting fond of him he was perfectly open and honorable about meg for he told us he loved her but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him he only wanted our leave to love her and work for her and the right to make her love him if he could he is a truly excellent young man and we could not refuse to listen to him but i will not consent to megs engaging herself so young of course not it would be idiotic i knew there was mischief brewing i felt it and now its worse than i imagined i just wish i could marry meg myself and keep her safe in the family this odd arrangement made mrs march smile but she said gravely jo i confide in you and dont wish you to say anything to meg yet when john comes back and i see them together i can judge better of her feelings toward him shell see his in those handsome eyes that she talks about and then it will be all up with her shes got such a soft heart it will melt like butter in the sun if any one looks sentimentally at her she read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters and pinched me when i spoke of it and likes brown eyes and doesnt think john an ugly name and shell go and fall in love and theres an end of peace and fun and cosy times together i see it all theyll go lovering around the house and we shall have to dodge meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow carry her off and make a hole in the family and i shall break my heart and everything will be abominably uncomfortable oh dear me why werent we all boys then there wouldnt be any bother jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible john mrs march sighed and jo looked up with an air of relief you dont like it mother im glad of it lets send him about his business and not tell meg a word of it but all be happy together as we always have been i did wrong to sigh jo it is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time but i do want to keep my girls as long as i can and i am sorry that this happened so soon for meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before john can make a home for her your father and i have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way nor be married before twenty if she and john love one another they can wait and test the love by doing so she is conscientious and i have no fear of her treating him unkindly my pretty tenderhearted girl i hope things will go happily with her hadnt you rather have her marry a rich man asked jo as her mothers voice faltered a little over the last words money is a good and useful thing jo and i hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly nor be tempted by too much i should like to know that john was firmly established in some good business which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make meg comfortable im not ambitious for a splendid fortune a fashionable position or a great name for my girls if rank and money come with love and virtue also i should accept them gratefully and enjoy your good fortune but i know by experience how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house where the daily bread is earned and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures i am content to see meg begin humbly for if i am not mistaken she will be rich in the possession of a good mans heart and that is better than a fortune i understand mother and quite agree but im disappointed about meg for id planned to have her marry teddy by and by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days wouldnt it be nice asked jo looking up with a brighter face he is younger than she you know began mrs march but jo broke in only a little hes old for his age and tall and can be quite grownup in his manners if he likes then hes rich and generous and good and loves us all and i say its a pity my plan is spoilt im afraid laurie is hardly grown up enough for meg and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for any one to depend on dont make plans jo but let time and their own hearts mate your friends we cant meddle safely in such matters and had better not get romantic rubbish as you call it into our heads lest it spoil our friendship well i wont but i hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up but buds will be roses and kittens catsmores the pity whats that about flatirons and cats asked meg as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand only one of my stupid speeches im going to bed come peggy said jo unfolding herself like an animated puzzle quite right and beautifully written please add that i send my love to john said mrs march as she glanced over the letter and gave it back do you call him john asked meg smiling with her innocent eyes looking down into her mothers yes he has been like a son to us and we are very fond of him replied mrs march returning the look with a keen one im glad of that he is so lonely goodnight mother dear it is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here was megs quiet answer the kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one and as she went away mrs march said with a mixture of satisfaction and regret she does not love john yet but will soon learn to illustration tailpiece illustration letters xxi laurie makes mischief and jo makes peace jos face was a study next day for the secret rather weighed upon her and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important meg observed it but did not trouble herself to make inquiries for she had learned that the best way to manage jo was by the law of contraries so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask she was rather surprised therefore when the silence remained unbroken and jo assumed a patronizing air which decidedly aggravated meg who in her turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother this left jo to her own devices for mrs march had taken her place as nurse and bade her rest exercise and amuse herself after her long confinement amy being gone laurie was her only refuge and much as she enjoyed his society she rather dreaded him just then for he was an incorrigible tease and she feared he would coax her secret from her she was quite right for the mischiefloving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out and led jo a trying life of it he wheedled bribed ridiculed threatened and scolded affected indifference that he might surprise the truth from her declared he knew then that he didnt care and at last by dint of perseverance he satisfied himself that it concerned meg and mr brooke feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutors confidence he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her fathers return but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her and for a day or two she was quite unlike herself she started when spoken to blushed when looked at was very quiet and sat over her sewing with a timid troubled look on her face to her mothers inquiries she answered that she was quite well and jos she silenced by begging to be let alone she feels it in the airlove i meanand shes going very fast shes got most of the symptomsis twittery and cross doesnt eat lies awake and mopes in corners i caught her singing that song he gave her and once she said john as you do and then turned as red as a poppy whatever shall we do said jo looking ready for any measures however violent nothing but wait let her alone be kind and patient and fathers coming will settle everything replied her mother heres a note to you meg all sealed up how odd teddy never seals mine said jo next day as she distributed the contents of the little postoffice mrs march and jo were deep in their own affairs when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face my child what is it cried her mother running to her while jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief its all a mistakehe didnt send it o jo how could you do it and meg hid her face in her hands crying as if her heart was quite broken me ive done nothing whats she talking about cried jo bewildered megs mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at jo saying reproachfully you wrote it and that bad boy helped you how could you be so rude so mean and cruel to us both jo hardly heard her for she and her mother were reading the note which was written in a peculiar hand illustration jo and her mother were reading the note my dearest margaret i can no longer restrain my passion and must know my fate before i return i dare not tell your parents yet but i think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another mr laurence will help me to some good place and then my sweet girl you will make me happy i implore you to say nothing to your family yet but to send one word of hope through laurie to your devoted john oh the little villain thats the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to mother ill give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon cried jo burning to execute immediate justice but her mother held her back saying with a look she seldom wore stop jo you must clear yourself first you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this on my word mother i havent i never saw that note before and dont know anything about it as true as i live said jo so earnestly that they believed her if i had taken a part in it id have done it better than this and have written a sensible note i should think youd have known mr brooke wouldnt write such stuff as that she added scornfully tossing down the paper its like his writing faltered meg comparing it with the note in her hand o meg you didnt answer it cried mrs march quickly yes i did and meg hid her face again overcome with shame heres a scrape do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured i cant rest till i get hold of him and jo made for the door again hush let me manage this for it is worse than i thought margaret tell me the whole story commanded mrs march sitting down by meg yet keeping hold of jo lest she should fly off i received the first letter from laurie who didnt look as if he knew anything about it began meg without looking up i was worried at first and meant to tell you then i remembered how you liked mr brooke so i thought you wouldnt mind if i kept my little secret for a few days im so silly that i liked to think no one knew and while i was deciding what to say i felt like the girls in books who have such things to do forgive me mother im paid for my silliness now i never can look him in the face again what did you say to him asked mrs march i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet that i didnt wish to have secrets from you and he must speak to father i was very grateful for his kindness and would be his friend but nothing more for a long while mrs march smiled as if well pleased and jo clapped her hands exclaiming with a laugh you are almost equal to caroline percy who was a pattern of prudence tell on meg what did he say to that he writes in a different way entirely telling me that he never sent any loveletter at all and is very sorry that my roguish sister jo should take such liberties with our names its very kind and respectful but think how dreadful for me meg leaned against her mother looking the image of despair and jo tramped about the room calling laurie names all of a sudden she stopped caught up the two notes and after looking at them closely said decidedly i dont believe brooke ever saw either of these letters teddy wrote both and keeps yours to crow over me with because i wouldnt tell him my secret dont have any secrets jo tell it to mother and keep out of trouble as i should have done said meg warningly bless you child mother told me that will do jo ill comfort meg while you go and get laurie i shall sift the matter to the bottom and put a stop to such pranks at once away ran jo and mrs march gently told meg mr brookes real feelings now dear what are your own do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you or will you keep yourself quite free for the present ive been so scared and worried i dont want to have anything to do with lovers for a long whileperhaps never answered meg petulantly if john doesnt know anything about this nonsense dont tell him and make jo and laurie hold their tongues i wont be deceived and plagued and made a fool ofits a shame seeing that megs usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke mrs march soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future the instant lauries step was heard in the hall meg fled into the study and mrs march received the culprit alone jo had not told him why he was wanted fearing he wouldnt come but he knew the minute he saw mrs marchs face and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once jo was dismissed but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel having some fear that the prisoner might bolt the sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour but what happened during that interview the girls never knew when they were called in laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot but did not think it wise to betray the fact meg received his humble apology and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke ill never tell him to my dying daywild horses shant drag it out of me so youll forgive me meg and ill do anything to show how outandout sorry i am he added looking very much ashamed of himself ill try but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do i didnt think you could be so sly and malicious laurie replied meg trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air it was altogether abominable and i dont deserve to be spoken to for a month but you will though wont you and laurie folded his hands together with such an imploring gesture as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior meg pardoned him and mrs marchs grave face relaxed in spite of her efforts to keep sober when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel jo stood aloof meanwhile trying to harden her heart against him and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation laurie looked at her once or twice but as she showed no sign of relenting he felt injured and turned his back on her till the others were done with him when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word as soon as he had gone she wished she had been more forgiving and when meg and her mother went upstairs she felt lonely and longed for teddy after resisting for some time she yielded to the impulse and armed with a book to return went over to the big house is mr laurence in asked jo of a housemaid who was coming down stairs yes miss but i dont believe hes seeable just yet why not is he ill la no miss but hes had a scene with mr laurie who is in one of his tantrums about something which vexes the old gentleman so i dursnt go nigh him where is laurie shut up in his room and he wont answer though ive been atapping i dont know whats to become of the dinner for its ready and theres no one to eat it ill go and see what the matter is im not afraid of either of them up went jo and knocked smartly on the door of lauries little study stop that or ill open the door and make you called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone jo immediately knocked again the door flew open and in she bounced before laurie could recover from his surprise seeing that he really was out of temper jo who knew how to manage him assumed a contrite expression and going artistically down upon her knees said meekly please forgive me for being so cross i came to make it up and cant go away till i have its all right get up and dont be a goose jo was the cavalier reply to her petition illustration get up and dont be a goose thank you i will could i ask whats the matter you dont look exactly easy in your mind ive been shaken and i wont bear it growled laurie indignantly who did it demanded jo grandfather if it had been any one else id have and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm thats nothing i often shake you and you dont mind said jo soothingly pooh youre a girl and its fun but ill allow no man to shake me i dont think any one would care to try it if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now why were you treated so just because i wouldnt say what your mother wanted me for id promised not to tell and of course i wasnt going to break my word couldnt you satisfy your grandpa in any other way no he would have the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth id have told my part of the scrape if i could without bringing meg in as i couldnt i held my tongue and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me then i got angry and bolted for fear i should forget myself it wasnt nice but hes sorry i know so go down and make up ill help you hanged if i do im not going to be lectured and pummelled by every one just for a bit of a frolic i was sorry about meg and begged pardon like a man but i wont do it again when i wasnt in the wrong he didnt know that he ought to trust me and not act as if i was a baby its no use jo hes got to learn that im able to take care of myself and dont need any ones apronstring to hold on by what pepperpots you are sighed jo how do you mean to settle this affair well he ought to beg pardon and believe me when i say i cant tell him what the fusss about bless you he wont do that i wont go down till he does now teddy be sensible let it pass and ill explain what i can you cant stay here so whats the use of being melodramatic i dont intend to stay here long any way ill slip off and take a journey somewhere and when grandpa misses me hell come round fast enough i dare say but you ought not to go and worry him dont preach ill go to washington and see brooke its gay there and ill enjoy myself after the troubles what fun youd have i wish i could run off too said jo forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital come on then why not you go and surprise your father and ill stir up old brooke it would be a glorious joke lets do it jo well leave a letter saying we are all right and trot off at once ive got money enough it will do you good and be no harm as you go to your father for a moment jo looked as if she would agree for wild as the plan was it just suited her she was tired of care and confinement longed for change and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals liberty and fun her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window but they fell on the old house opposite and she shook her head with sorrowful decision if i was a boy wed run away together and have a capital time but as im a miserable girl i must be proper and stop at home dont tempt me teddy its a crazy plan thats the fun of it began laurie who had got a wilful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears prunes and prisms are my doom and i may as well make up my mind to it i came here to moralize not to hear about things that make me skip to think of illustration hold your tongue cried jo covering her ears i know meg would wetblanket such a proposal but i thought you had more spirit began laurie insinuatingly bad boy be quiet sit down and think of your own sins dont go making me add to mine if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking will you give up running away asked jo seriously yes but you wont do it answered laurie who wished to make up but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first if i can manage the young one i can the old one muttered jo as she walked away leaving laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands come in and mr laurences gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever as jo tapped at his door its only me sir come to return a book she said blandly as she entered want any more asked the old gentleman looking grim and vexed but trying not to show it yes please i like old sam so well i think ill try the second volume returned jo hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of boswells johnson as he had recommended that lively work the shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the johnsonian literature was placed jo skipped up and sitting on the top step affected to be searching for her book but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit mr laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind for after taking several brisk turns about the room he faced round on her speaking so abruptly that rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor what has that boy been about dont try to shield him i know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home i cant get a word from him and when i threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room he did do wrong but we forgave him and all promised not to say a word to any one began jo reluctantly that wont do he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls if hes done anything amiss he shall confess beg pardon and be punished out with it jo i wont be kept in the dark mr laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that jo would have gladly run away if she could but she was perched aloft on the steps and he stood at the foot a lion in the path so she had to stay and brave it out illustration he stood at the foot like a lion in the path indeed sir i cannot tell mother forbade it laurie has confessed asked pardon and been punished quite enough we dont keep silence to shield him but some one else and it will make more trouble if you interfere please dont it was partly my fault but its all right now so lets forget it and talk about the rambler or something pleasant hang the rambler come down and give me your word that this harumscarum boy of mine hasnt done anything ungrateful or impertinent if he has after all your kindness to him ill thrash him with my own hands the threat sounded awful but did not alarm jo for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson whatever he might say to the contrary she obediently descended and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying meg or forgetting the truth humhawell if the boy held his tongue because he promised and not from obstinacy ill forgive him hes a stubborn fellow and hard to manage said mr laurence rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief so am i but a kind word will govern me when all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt said jo trying to say a kind word for her friend who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another you think im not kind to him hey was the sharp answer oh dear no sir you are rather too kind sometimes and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience dont you think you are jo was determined to have it out now and tried to look quite placid though she quaked a little after her bold speech to her great relief and surprise the old gentleman only threw his spectacles on to the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly youre right girl i am i love the boy but he tries my patience past bearing and i dont know how it will end if we go on so ill tell you hell run away jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made she meant to warn him that laurie would not bear much restraint and hoped he would be more forbearing with the lad mr laurences ruddy face changed suddenly and he sat down with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man which hung over his table it was lauries father who had run away in his youth and married against the imperious old mans will jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past and she wished she had held her tongue he wont do it unless he is very much worried and only threatens it sometimes when he gets tired of studying i often think i should like to especially since my hair was cut so if you ever miss us you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for india she laughed as she spoke and mr laurence looked relieved evidently taking the whole as a joke you hussy how dare you talk in that way wheres your respect for me and your proper bringing up bless the boys and girls what torments they are yet we cant do without them he said pinching her cheeks goodhumoredly go and bring that boy down to his dinner tell him its all right and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather i wont bear it he wont come sir he feels badly because you didnt believe him when he said he couldnt tell i think the shaking hurt his feelings very much jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed for mr laurence began to laugh and she knew the day was won im sorry for that and ought to thank him for not shaking me i suppose what the dickens does the fellow expect and the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness if i were you id write him an apology sir he says he wont come down till he has one and talks about washington and goes on in an absurd way a formal apology will make him see how foolish he is and bring him down quite amiable try it he likes fun and this way is better than talking ill carry it up and teach him his duty mr laurence gave her a sharp look and put on his spectacles saying slowly youre a sly puss but i dont mind being managed by you and beth here give me a bit of paper and let us have done with this nonsense the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult jo dropped a kiss on the top of mr laurences bald head and ran up to slip the apology under lauries door advising him through the keyhole to be submissive decorous and a few other agreeable impossibilities finding the door locked again she left the note to do its work and was going quietly away when the young gentleman slid down the banisters and waited for her at the bottom saying with his most virtuous expression of countenance what a good fellow you are jo did you get blown up he added laughing no he was pretty mild on the whole ah i got it all round even you cast me off over there and i felt just ready to go to the deuce he began apologetically dont talk in that way turn over a new leaf and begin again teddy my son i keep turning over new leaves and spoiling them as i used to spoil my copybooks and i make so many beginnings there never will be an end he said dolefully go and eat your dinner youll feel better after it men always croak when they are hungry and jo whisked out at the front door after that thats a label on my sect answered laurie quoting amy as he went to partake of humblepie dutifully with his grandfather who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day every one thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over but the mischief was done for though others forgot it meg remembered she never alluded to a certain person but she thought of him a good deal dreamed dreams more than ever and once jo rummaging her sisters desk for stamps found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words mrs john brooke whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire feeling that lauries prank had hastened the evil day for her illustration beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day xxii pleasant meadows like sunshine after storm were the peaceful weeks which followed the invalids improved rapidly and mr march began to talk of returning early in the new year beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the wellbeloved cats at first and in time with dolls sewing which had fallen sadly behindhand her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that jo took her a daily airing about the house in her strong arms meg cheerfully blackened and burnt her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept as christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry christmas laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way after many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success to begin with mr march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her mothers gifta soft crimson merino wrapperwas borne in triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise out in the garden stood a stately snowmaiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of new music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer the jungfrau to beth god bless you dear queen bess may nothing you dismay but health and peace and happiness be yours this christmas day heres fruit to feed our busy bee and flowers for her nose heres music for her pianee an afghan for her toes a portrait of joanna see by raphael no 2 who labored with great industry to make it fair and true accept a ribbon red i beg for madam purrers tail and icecream made by lovely peg a mont blanc in a pail their dearest love my makers laid within my breast of snow accept it and the alpine maid from laurie and from jo illustration the jungfrau how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them im so full of happiness that if father was only here i couldnt hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the longdesired undine and sintram im sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress for mr laurence had insisted on giving it how can i be otherwise said mrs march gratefully as her eyes went from her husbands letter to beths smiling face and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort that is half an hour after every one had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian warwhoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that every one jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice heres another christmas present for the march family before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and couldnt of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word mr march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the chinacloset mr brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her fathers boots in the most touching manner mrs march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth but it was too late the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the thresholdjoy put strength into the feeble limbsand beth ran straight into her fathers arms never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen as the laugh subsided mrs march began to thank mr brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr brooke suddenly remembered that mr march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard mr march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man why mr march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine also why mrs march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he wouldnt have something to eat jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beeftea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated so was the plumpudding which quite melted in ones mouth likewise the jellies in which amy revelled like a fly in a honeypot everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that its a merrycle i didnt roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth mr laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr brookeat whom jo glowered darkly to lauries infinite amusement two easychairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit they drank healths told stories sung songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time a sleighride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr brooke with dignity i think its been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes im glad its over because weve got you back whispered beth who sat on her fathers knee rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him how do you know did mother tell you asked jo not much straws show which way the wind blows and ive made several discoveries today oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him here is one and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier nowfor in these seeming blemishes i read a little history a burntoffering has been made of vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and im sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much goodwill went into the stitches meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments im proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her fathers hand and the approving smile he gave her what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her fathers ear he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with an unusually mild expression in her brown face in spite of the curly crop i dont see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr march i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower she doesnt bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied i dont know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i couldnt find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the fiveandtwenty dollars which my good girl sent me jos keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her fathers praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait theres so little of her im afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own ive got you safe my beth and ill keep you so please god after a minutes silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every one with patience and goodhumor i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mould her character as carefully as she moulds her little clay figures i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring i read in pilgrims progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all the year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their journeys end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her fathers arms and went slowly to the instrument its singing time now and i want to be in my old place ill try to sing the song of the shepherdboy which the pilgrims heard i made the music for father because he likes the verses so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sung to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her he that is down need fear no fall he that is low no pride he that is humble ever shall have god to be his guide i am content with what i have little be it or much and lord contentment still i crave because thou savest such fulness to them a burden is that go on pilgrimage here little and hereafter bliss is best from age to age xxiii aunt march settles the question illustration popping in her head now and then like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about mr march the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness as he sat propped up in a big chair by beths sofa with the other three close by and hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact mr and mrs march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at mr brookes umbrella which had been left in the hall meg was absentminded shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when johns name was mentioned amy said every one seemed waiting for something and couldnt settle down which was queer since father was safe at home and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didnt run over as usual illustration he sat in the big chair by beths sofa with the other three close bypage 277 laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down upon one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon and when meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair what does the goose mean said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious hes showing you how your john will go on by and by touching isnt it answered jo scornfully dont say my john it isnt proper or true but megs voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her please dont plague me jo ive told you i dont care much about him and there isnt to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before we cant for something has been said and lauries mischief has spoilt you for me i see it and so does mother you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me i dont mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but i do wish it was all settled i hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said jo pettishly i cant say or do anything till he speaks and he wont because father said i was too young began meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point if he did speak you wouldnt know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no im not so silly and weak as you think i know just what i should say for ive planned it all so i neednt be taken unawares theres no knowing what may happen and i wished to be prepared jo couldnt help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks would you mind telling me what youd say asked jo more respectfully not at all you are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidant and my experience will be useful to you by and by perhaps in your own affairs of this sort dont mean to have any its fun to watch other people philander but i should feel like a fool doing it myself said jo looking alarmed at the thought i think not if you liked any one very much and he liked you meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight i thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said jo rudely shortening her sisters little reverie oh i should merely say quite calmly and decidedly thank you mr brooke you are very kind but i agree with father that i am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were hum thats stiff and cool enough i dont believe youll ever say it and i know he wont be satisfied if you do if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books youll give in rather than hurt his feelings no i wont i shall tell him ive made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when some one gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable good afternoon i came to get my umbrellathat is to see how your father finds himself today said mr brooke getting a trifle confused as his eye went from one telltale face to the other its very well hes in the rack ill get him and tell it you are here and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle towards the door murmuring mother will like to see you pray sit down ill call her dont go are you afraid of me margaret and mr brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it illustration shall i tell you how shall i tell you how asked mr brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen oh no please dontid rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial i wont trouble you i only want to know if you care for me a little meg i love you so much dear added mr brooke tenderly this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg didnt make it she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i dont know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i cant go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not im too young faltered meg wondering why she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it ill wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me would it be a very hard lesson dear not if i chose to learn it but please choose to learn meg i love to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success this nettled her annie moffats foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i dont choose please go away and let me be poor mr brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away yes i do i dont want to be worried about such things father says i neednt its too soon and id rather not maynt i hope youll change your mind by and by ill wait and say nothing till you have had more time dont play with me meg i didnt think that of you dont think of me at all id rather you wouldnt said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lovers patience and her own power he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of her what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute the old lady couldnt resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr marchs arrival drove straight out to see him the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr brooke vanished into the study bless me whats all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady illustration bless me whats all this its fathers friend im so surprised to see you stammered meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now thats evident returned aunt march sitting down but what is fathers friend saying to make you look like a peony theres mischief going on and i insist upon knowing what it is with another rap we were merely talking mr brooke came for his umbrella began meg wishing that mr brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house brooke that boys tutor ah i understand now i know all about it jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your fathers letters and i made her tell me you havent gone and accepted him child cried aunt march looking scandalized hush hell hear shant i call mother said meg much troubled not yet ive something to say to you and i must free my mind at once tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it the best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke she would probably have declared she couldnt think of it but as she was peremptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit i shall marry whom i please aunt march and you can leave your money to any one you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air highty tighty is that the way you take my advice miss youll be sorry for it by and by when youve tried love in a cottage and found it a failure it cant be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted meg aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independentso glad to defend john and assert her right to love him if she liked aunt march saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could now meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice i mean it kindly and dont want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning you ought to marry well and help your family its your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you father and mother dont think so they like john though he is poor your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than two babies im glad of it cried meg stoutly aunt march took no notice but went on with her lecture this rook is poor and hasnt got any rich relations has he no but he has many warm friends you cant live on friends try it and see how cool theyll grow he hasnt any business has he not yet mr laurence is going to help him that wont last long james laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on so you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better i thought you had more sense meg i couldnt do better if i waited half my life john is good and wise hes got heaps of talent hes willing to work and sure to get on hes so energetic and brave every one likes and respects him and im proud to think he cares for me though im so poor and young and silly said meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness he knows you have got rich relations child thats the secret of his liking i suspect aunt march how dare you say such a thing john is above such meanness and i wont listen to you a minute if you talk so cried meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old ladys suspicions my john wouldnt marry for money anymore than i would we are willing to work and we mean to wait im not afraid of being poor for ive been happy so far and i know i shall be with him because he loves me and i meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she hadnt made up her mind that she had told her john to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the girls happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour well i wash my hands of the whole affair you are a wilful child and youve lost more than you know by this piece of folly no i wont stop im disappointed in you and havent spirits to see your father now dont expect anything from me when you are married your mr books friends must take care of you im done with you forever and slamming the door in megs face aunt march drove off in high dudgeon she seemed to take all the girls courage with her for when left alone meg stood a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by mr brooke who said all in one breath i couldnt help hearing meg thank you for defending me and aunt march for proving that you do care for me a little bit i didnt know how much till she abused you began meg and i neednt go away but may stay and be happy may i dear here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in jos eyes by meekly whispering yes john and hiding her face on mr brookes waistcoat fifteen minutes after aunt marchs departure jo came softly down stairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself she has sent him away as we planned and that affair is settled ill go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it but poor jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strongminded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold showerbath had suddenly fallen upon herfor such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer sister jo congratulate us that was adding insult to injuryit was altogether too muchand making some wild demonstration with her hands jo vanished without a word rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room oh do somebody go down quick john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it mr and mrs march left the room with speed and casting herself upon the bed jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to beth and amy the little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet mr brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it the teabell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that jo hadnt the heart to be jealous or dismal amy was very much impressed by johns devotion and megs dignity beth beamed at them from a distance while mr and mrs march surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident aunt march was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies no one ate much but every one looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there you cant say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you meg said amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in the sketch she was planning to take no im sure i cant how much has happened since i said that it seems a year ago answered meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter the joys come close upon the sorrows this time and i rather think the changes have begun said mrs march in most families there comes now and then a year full of events this has been such an one but it ends well after all hope the next will end better muttered jo who found it very hard to see meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way i hope the third year from this will end better i mean it shall if i live to work out my plans said mr brooke smiling at meg as if everything had become possible to him now doesnt it seem very long to wait asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding ive got so much to learn before i shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before you have only to wait i am to do the work said john beginning his labors by picking up megs napkin with an expression which caused jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged here comes laurie now we shall have a little sensible conversation but jo was mistaken for laurie came prancing in overflowing with spirits bearing a great bridallooking bouquet for mrs john brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management illustration for mrs john brooke i knew brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything its done though the sky falls said laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations much obliged for that recommendation i take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered mr brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil ill come if im at the ends of the earth for the sight of jos face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey you dont look festive maam whats the matter asked laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet mr laurence i dont approve of the match but ive made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said jo solemnly you cant know how hard it is for me to give up meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice you dont give her up you only go halves said laurie consolingly it never can be the same again ive lost my dearest friend sighed jo youve got me anyhow im not good for much i know but ill stand by you jo all the days of my life upon my word i will and laurie meant what he said i know you will and im ever so much obliged you are always a great comfort to me teddy returned jo gratefully shaking hands well now dont be dismal theres a good fellow its all right you see meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house well have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then well go abroad or some nice trip or other wouldnt that console you i rather think it would but theres no knowing what may happen in three years said jo thoughtfully thats true dont you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then i do returned laurie i think not for i might see something sad and every one looks so happy now i dont believe they could be much improved and jos eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one father and mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both so grouped the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given to the first act of the domestic drama called little women illustration home of the little women the second part illustration the dove cote xxiv gossip in order that we may start afresh and go to megs wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the marches and here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as i fear they may im not afraid the young folks will make that objection i can only say with mrs march what can you expect when i have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family the war is over and mr march safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by gracea quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely these attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop earnest young men found the grayheaded scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts and sorrows to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel sinners told their sins to the purehearted old man and were both rebuked and saved gifted men found a companion in him ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they wouldnt pay to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father the girls gave their hearts into their mothers keeping their souls into their fathers and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death mrs march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in megs affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly missionarys visits john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr laurences more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestlyearned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg couldnt help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot sallies splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene busy with the quiet duties she loved every ones friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoilt and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at amys shrine and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote that was the name of the little brown house which mr brooke had prepared for megs first home laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pockethandkerchief in front here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a weatherbeaten urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the diningroom was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pellmell into the coalbin but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory there were no marbletopped tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the baywindow and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought i dont think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than amys artistic hand or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away megs few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandynew kitchen never could have looked so cosey and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis brooke came home i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piecebags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over lauries ridiculous bargains in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was as much of a boy as ever his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeggrater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knifecleaner that spoilt all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt laborsaving soap that took the skin off ones hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savingsbank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process in vain meg begged him to stop john laughed at him and jo called him mr toodles he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth so each week beheld some fresh absurdity everything was done at last even to amys arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and beths setting the table for the first meal are you satisfied does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked mrs march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arminarm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i cant talk about it answered meg with a look that was better than words if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly sallie moffat has four began amy if meg had four the house wouldnt hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the doorhandles sallie isnt a poor mans wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one its a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancy work and tending my pocket handkerchief why didnt you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by and by when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served yes mother im sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the allabsorbing subject of housekeeping do you know i like this room most of all in my babyhouse added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her wellstored linencloset beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array all three laughed as meg spoke for that linencloset was a joke you see having said that if meg married that brooke she shouldnt have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself mrs carrol florences mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the oldfashioned pearls long promised to the first bride thats a housewifely taste which i am glad to see i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness i havent a single fingerbowl but this is a set out that will last me all my days hannah says and meg looked quite contented as well she might toodles is coming cried jo from below and they all went down to meet laurie whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives a tall broadshouldered young fellow with a cropped head a feltbasin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs march with both hands out and a hearty here i am mother yes its all right the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss for mrs john brooke with the makers congratulations and compliments bless you beth what a refreshing spectacle you are jo amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pulled beths hairribbon stared at jos big pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and every one began to talk where is john asked meg anxiously stopped to get the license for tomorrow maam which side won the last match teddy inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years ours of course wish youd been there to see how is the lovely miss randal asked amy with a significant smile more cruel than ever dont you see how im pining away and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh whats the last joke undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity its a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a watchmans rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls illustration a small watchmans rattle any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy nice thing isnt it and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears theres gratitude for you and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your weddingcake from destruction i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she hadnt defended it manfully id have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone im doing my best maam but cant get much higher im afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick and span new bower so as im tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently mother and i are going to wait for john there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away beth and i are going over to kitty bryants to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody come jo dont desert a fellow im in such a state of exhaustion i cant get home without help dont take off your apron whatever you do its peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered him her arm to support his feeble steps now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans not a prank and dont say funny things when we ought to be sober i never do you are the one for that and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony i shall certainly laugh if you do you wont see me youll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect i never cry unless for some great affliction such as fellows going to college hey cut in laurie with a suggestive laugh dont be a peacock i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company exactly i say jo how is grandpa this week pretty amiable very why have you got into a scrape and want to know how hell take it asked jo rather sharply now jo do you think id look your mother in the face and say all right if it wasnt and laurie stopped short with an injured air no i dont then dont go and be suspicious i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone you spend a great deal teddy bless you i dont spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it you are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow and cant say no to any one we heard about henshaw and all you did for him if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly oh he made a mountain out of a molehill you wouldnt have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for the want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you of course not but i dont see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home i thought youd got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot just now its the fashion to be hideousto make your head look like a scrubbingbrush wear a straitjacket orange gloves and clumping squaretoed boots if it was cheap ugliness id say nothing but it costs as much as the other and i dont get any satisfaction out of it laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the feltbasin fell off and jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a roughandready costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket dont lecture any more theres a good soul i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home ill get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends ill leave you in peace if youll only let your hair grow im not aristocratic but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prizefighter observed jo severely this unassuming style promotes study thats why we adopt it returned laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarterofaninchlong stubble by the way jo i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy he talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner hed better nip his little passion in the bud hadnt he added laurie in a confidential elderbrotherly tone after a minutes silence of course he had we dont want any more marrying in this family for years to come mercy on us what are the children thinking of and jo looked as much scandalized as if amy and little parker were not yet in their teens its a fast age and i dont know what we are coming to maam you are a mere infant but youll go next jo and well be left lamenting said laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times dont be alarmed im not one of the agreeable sort nobody will want me and its a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family you wont give any one a chance said laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburnt face you wont show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and cant help showing that he likes it you treat him as mrs gummidge did her sweetheartthrow cold water over himand get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you i dont like that sort of thing im too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think its dreadful to break up families so now dont say any more about it megs wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities i dont wish to get cross so lets change the subject and jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation whatever his feelings might have been laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate mark my words jo youll go next illustration tailpiece illustration the first wedding xxv the first wedding the june roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the diningroom windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest fullblown flower to the palest babybud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty neither silk lace nor orangeflowers would she have i dont want to look strange or fixed up today she said i dont want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom i love and to them i wish to look and be my familiar self so she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her john liked best of all the flowers that grew you do look just like our own dear meg only so very sweet and lovely that i should hug you if it wouldnt crumple your dress cried amy surveying her with delight when all was done then i am satisfied but please hug and kiss me every one and dont mind my dress i want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today and meg opened her arms to her sisters who clung about her with april faces for a minute feeling that the new love had not changed the old now im going to tie johns cravat for him and then to stay a few minutes with father quietly in the study and meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies and then to follow her mother wherever she went conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest as the younger girls stand together giving the last touches to their simple toilet it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance for all are looking their best just now jos angles are much softened she has learned to carry herself with ease if not grace the curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever the beautiful kind eyes are larger and in them lies an expression that saddens one although it is not sad itself it is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience but beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of being better soon amy is with truth considered the flower of the family for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a fullgrown womannot beautiful but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace one saw it in the lines of her figure the make and motion of her hands the flow of her dress the droop of her hairunconscious yet harmonious and as attractive to many as beauty itself amys nose still afflicted her for it never would grow grecian so did her mouth being too wide and having a decided chin these offending features gave character to her whole face but she never could see it and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion keen blue eyes and curls more golden and abundant than ever all three wore suits of thin silver gray their best gowns for the summer with blushroses in hair and bosom and all three looked just what they werefreshfaced happyhearted girls pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood there were to be no ceremonious performances everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible so when aunt march arrived she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a winebottle under each arm upon my word heres a state of things cried the old lady taking the seat of honor prepared for her and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle you oughtnt to be seen till the last minute child im not a show aunty and no one is coming to stare at me to criticise my dress or count the cost of my luncheon im too happy to care what any one says or thinks and im going to have my little wedding just as i like it john dear heres your hammer and away went meg to help that man in his highly improper employment mr brooke didnt even say thank you but as he stooped for the unromantic tool he kissed his little bride behind the foldingdoor with a look that made aunt march whisk out her pockethandkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes a crash a cry and a laugh from laurie accompanied by the indecorous exclamation jupiter ammon jos upset the cake again caused a momentary flurry which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived and the party came in as beth used to say when a child dont let that young giant come near me he worries me worse than mosquitoes whispered the old lady to amy as the rooms filled and lauries black head towered above the rest he has promised to be very good today and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes returned amy gliding away to warn hercules to beware of the dragon which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her there was no bridal procession but a sudden silence fell upon the room as mr march and the young pair took their places under the green arch mother and sisters gathered close as if loath to give meg up the fatherly voice broke more than once which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn the bridegrooms hand trembled visibly and no one heard his replies but meg looked straight up in her husbands eyes and said i will with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mothers heart rejoiced and aunt march sniffed audibly jo did not cry though she was very near it once and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that laurie was staring fixedly at her with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes beth kept her face hidden on her mothers shoulder but amy stood like a graceful statue with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair it wasnt at all the thing im afraid but the minute she was fairly married meg cried the first kiss for marmee and turning gave it with her heart on her lips during the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever for every one availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent from mr laurence to old hannah who adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made fell upon her in the hall crying with a sob and a chuckle bless you deary a hundred times the cake aint hurt a mite and everything looks lovely everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light there was no display of gifts for they were already in the little house nor was there an elaborate breakfast but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit dressed with flowers mr laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water lemonade and coffee were found to be the only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried round no one said anything however till laurie who insisted on serving the bride appeared before her with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face has jo smashed all the bottles by accident he whispered or am i merely laboring under a delusion that i saw some lying about loose this morning no your grandfather kindly offered us his best and aunt march actually sent some but father put away a little for beth and despatched the rest to the soldiers home you know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness and mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh but he did neither for after a quick look at her he said in his impetuous way i like that for ive seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do you are not made wise by experience i hope and there was an anxious accent in megs voice no i give you my word for it dont think too well of me either this is not one of my temptations being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless i dont care for it but when a pretty girl offers it one doesnt like to refuse you see but you will for the sake of others if not for your own come laurie promise and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment for ridicule is often harder to bear than selfdenial meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs and feeling her power used it as a woman may for her friends good she did not speak but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness and a smile which said no one can refuse me anything today laurie certainly could not and with an answering smile he gave her his hand saying heartily i promise mrs brooke i thank you very very much and i drink long life to your resolution teddy cried jo baptizing him with a splash of lemonade as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him so the toast was drunk the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations for with instinctive wisdom the girls had seized a happy moment to do their friend a service for which he thanked them all his life after lunch people strolled about by twos and threes through house and garden enjoying the sunshine without and within meg and john happened to be standing together in the middle of the grassplot when laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding all the married people take hands and dance round the newmade husband and wife as the germans do while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside cried laurie promenading down the path with amy with such infectious spirit and skill that every one else followed their example without a murmur mr and mrs march aunt and uncle carrol began it others rapidly joined in even sallie moffat after a moments hesitation threw her train over her arm and whisked ned into the ring but the crowning joke was mr laurence and aunt march for when the stately old gentleman chassed solemnly up to the old lady she just tucked her cane under her arm and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close and then people began to go i wish you well my dear i heartily wish you well but i think youll be sorry for it said aunt march to meg adding to the bridegroom as he led her to the carriage youve got a treasure young man see that you deserve it that is the prettiest wedding ive been to for an age ned and i dont see why for there wasnt a bit of style about it observed mrs moffat to her husband as they drove away laurie my lad if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing get one of those little girls to help you and i shall be perfectly satisfied said mr laurence settling himself in his easychair to rest after the excitement of the morning ill do my best to gratify you sir was lauries unusually dutiful reply as he carefully unpinned the posy jo had put in his buttonhole the little house was not far away and the only bridal journey meg had was the quiet walk with john from the old home to the new when she came down looking like a pretty quakeress in her dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white they all gathered about her to say goodby as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour dont feel that i am separated from you marmee dear or that i love you any the less for loving john so much she said clinging to her mother with full eyes for a moment i shall come every day father and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts though i am married beth is going to be with me a great deal and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles thank you all for my happy weddingday goodby goodby they stood watching her with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away leaning on her husbands arm with her hands full of flowers and the june sunshine brightening her happy faceand so megs married life began illustration artistic attempts xxvi artistic attempts it takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius especially ambitious young men and women amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity for a long time there was a lull in the mudpie business and she devoted herself to the finest penandink drawing in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable but overstrained eyes soon caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at pokersketching while this attack lasted the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency redhot pokers lay about promiscuously and hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinnerbell at her door in case of fire raphaels face was found boldly executed on the under side of the mouldingboard and bacchus on the head of a beerbarrel a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugarbucket and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindlings for some time from fire to oil was a natural transition for burnt fingers and amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor an artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes brushes and colors and she daubed away producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance swarthy boys and darkeyed madonnas staring at you from one corner of the studio suggested murillo oilybrown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place meant rembrandt buxom ladies and dropsical infants rubens and turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder orange lightning brown rain and purple clouds with a tomatocolored splash in the middle which might be the sun or a buoy a sailors shirt or a kings robe as the spectator pleased charcoal portraits came next and the entire family hung in a row looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin softened into crayon sketches they did better for the likenesses were good and amys hair jos nose megs mouth and lauries eyes were pronounced wonderfully fine a return to clay and plaster followed and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house or tumbled off closetshelves on to peoples heads children were enticed in as models till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused miss amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress her efforts in this line however were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident which quenched her ardor other models failing her for a time she undertook to cast her own pretty foot and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a panfull of plaster which had hardened with unexpected rapidity with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far cut the poor foot and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt at least illustration her foot held fast in a panful of plaster after this amy subsided till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river field and wood for picturesque studies and sighing for ruins to copy she caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book a delicious bit composed of a stone a stump one mushroom and a broken mulleinstalk or a heavenly mass of clouds that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done she sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after points of sight or whatever the squintandstring performance is called if genius is eternal patience as michael angelo affirms amy certainly had some claim to the divine attribute for she persevered in spite of all obstacles failures and discouragements firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called high art she was learning doing and enjoying other things meanwhile for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman even if she never became a great artist here she succeeded better for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort make friends everywhere and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star everybody liked her for among her good gifts was tact she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper always said the right thing to the right person did just what suited the time and place and was so selfpossessed that her sisters used to say if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand shed know exactly what to do one of her weaknesses was a desire to move in our best society without being quite sure what the best really was money position fashionable accomplishments and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes and she liked to associate with those who possessed them often mistaking the false for the true and admiring what was not admirable never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her my lady as her friends called her sincerely desired to be a genuine lady and was so at heart but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature that rank does not always confer nobility and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks i want to ask a favor of you mamma amy said coming in with an important air one day well little girl what is it replied her mother in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained the baby our drawing class breaks up next week and before the girls separate for the summer i want to ask them out here for a day they are wild to see the river sketch the broken bridge and copy some of the things they admire in my book they have been very kind to me in many ways and i am grateful for they are all rich and know i am poor yet they never made any difference why should they and mrs march put the question with what the girls called her maria theresa air you know as well as i that it does make a difference with nearly every one so dont ruffle up like a dear motherly hen when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds the ugly duckling turned out a swan you know and amy smiled without bitterness for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit mrs march laughed and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked well my swan what is your plan i should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week to take them a drive to the places they want to see a row on the river perhaps and make a little artistic fte for them that looks feasible what do you want for lunch cake sandwiches fruit and coffee will be all that is necessary i suppose oh dear no we must have cold tongue and chicken french chocolate and icecream besides the girls are used to such things and i want my lunch to be proper and elegant though i do work for my living how many young ladies are there asked her mother beginning to look sober twelve or fourteen in the class but i dare say they wont all come bless me child you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about why mother how can you think of such a thing not more than six or eight will probably come so i shall hire a beachwagon and borrow mr laurences cherrybounce hannahs pronunciation of charbanc all this will be expensive amy not very ive calculated the cost and ill pay for it myself dont you think dear that as these girls are used to such things and the best we can do will be nothing new that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them as a change if nothing more and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we dont need and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances if i cant have it as i like i dont care to have it at all i know that i can carry it out perfectly well if you and the girls will help a little and i dont see why i cant if im willing to pay for it said amy with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy mrs march knew that experience was an excellent teacher and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna very well amy if your heart is set upon it and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money time and temper ill say no more talk it over with the girls and whichever way you decide ill do my best to help you thanks mother you are always so kind and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters meg agreed at once and promised her aid gladly offering anything she possessed from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first why in the world should you spend your money worry your family and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who dont care a sixpence for you i thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears french boots and rides in a coup said jo who being called from the tragical climax of her novel was not in the best mood for social enterprises i dont truckle and i hate being patronized as much as you do returned amy indignantly for the two still jangled when such questions arose the girls do care for me and i for them and theres a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense you dont care to make people like you to go into good society and cultivate your manners and tastes i do and i mean to make the most of every chance that comes you can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air and call it independence if you like thats not my way when amy whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side while jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument amys definition of jos idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing and the discussion took a more amiable turn much against her will jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to mrs grundy and help her sister through what she regarded as a nonsensical business the invitations were sent nearly all accepted and the following monday was set apart for the grand event hannah was out of humor because her weeks work was deranged and prophesied that ef the washin and ironin warnt done reglar nothin would go well anywheres this hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern but amys motto was nil desperandum and having made up her mind what to do she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles to begin with hannahs cooking didnt turn out well the chicken was tough the tongue too salt and the chocolate wouldnt froth properly then the cake and ice cost more than amy expected so did the wagon and various other expenses which seemed trifling at the outset counted up rather alarmingly afterward beth got cold and took to her bed meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home and jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages accidents and mistakes were uncommonly numerous serious and trying if it hadnt been for mother i never should have got through as amy declared afterward and gratefully remembered when the best joke of the season was entirely forgotten by everybody else if it was not fair on monday the young ladies were to come on tuesdayan arrangement which aggravated jo and hannah to the last degree on monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour it drizzled a little shone a little blew a little and didnt make up its mind till it was too late for any one else to make up theirs amy was up at dawn hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts that the house might be got in order the parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby but without stopping to sigh for what she had not she skilfully made the best of what she had arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet covering stains on the walls with pictures framed in ivy and filling up empty corners with homemade statuary which gave an artistic air to the room as did the lovely vases of flowers jo scattered about the lunch looked charmingly and as she surveyed it she sincerely hoped it would taste well and that the borrowed glass china and silver would get safely home again the carriages were promised meg and mother were all ready to do the honors beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind an aching head and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow and as she wearily dressed amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when lunch safely over she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights for the cherrybounce and the broken bridge were her strong points then came two hours of suspense during which she vibrated from parlor to porch while public opinion varied like the weathercock a smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve for nobody came and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast that nothing might be lost no doubt about the weather today they will certainly come so we must fly round and be ready for them said amy as the sun woke her next morning she spoke briskly but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about tuesday for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale i cant get any lobsters so you will have to do without salad today said mr march coming in half an hour later with an expression of placid despair use the chicken then the toughness wont matter in a salad advised his wife hannah left it on the kitchentable a minute and the kittens got at it im very sorry amy added beth who was still a patroness of cats then i must have a lobster for tongue alone wont do said amy decidedly shall i rush into town and demand one asked jo with the magnanimity of a martyr youd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper just to try me ill go myself answered amy whose temper was beginning to fail shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel travellingbasket she departed feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day after some delay the object of her desire was procured likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home and off she drove again well pleased with her own forethought as the omnibus contained only one other passenger a sleepy old lady amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to so busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer who entered without stopping the vehicle till a masculine voice said goodmorning miss march and looking up she beheld one of lauries most elegant college friends fervently hoping that he would get out before she did amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet and congratulating herself that she had on her new travelling dress returned the young mans greeting with her usual suavity and spirit they got on excellently for amys chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain when the old lady got out in stumbling to the door she upset the basket andoh horrorthe lobster in all its vulgar size and brilliancy was revealed to the highborn eyes of a tudor by jove shes forgotten her dinner cried the unconscious youth poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady please dontitsits mine murmured amy with a face nearly as red as her fish illustration please dont its mine oh really i beg pardon its an uncommonly fine one isnt it said tudor with great presence of mind and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding amy recovered herself in a breath set her basket boldly on the seat and said laughing dont you wish you were to have some of the salad hes to make and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it now that was tact for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences and curiosity about the charming young ladies diverted his mind from the comical mishap i suppose hell laugh and joke over it with laurie but i shant see them thats a comfort thought amy as tudor bowed and departed she did not mention this meeting at home though she discovered that thanks to the upset her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before and at twelve oclock all was ready again feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements she wished to efface the memory of yesterdays failure by a grand success today so she ordered the cherrybounce and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet theres the rumble theyre coming ill go into the porch to meet them it looks hospitable and i want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble said mrs march suiting the action to the word but after one glance she retired with an indescribable expression for looking quite lost in the big carriage sat amy and one young lady run beth and help hannah clear half the things off the table it will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl cried jo hurrying away to the lower regions too excited to stop even for a laugh in came amy quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise the rest of the family being of a dramatic turn played their parts equally well and miss eliott found them a most hilarious set for it was impossible to entirely control the merriment which possessed them the remodelled lunch being gayly partaken of the studio and garden visited and art discussed with enthusiasm amy ordered a buggy alas for the elegant cherrybounce and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset when the party went out as she came walking in looking very tired but as composed as ever she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fte had disappeared except a suspicious pucker about the corners of jos mouth youve had a lovely afternoon for your drive dear said her mother as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come miss eliott is a very sweet girl and seemed to enjoy herself i thought observed beth with unusual warmth could you spare me some of your cake i really need some i have so much company and i cant make such delicious stuff as yours asked meg soberly take it all im the only one here who likes sweet things and it will mould before i can dispose of it answered amy thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this its a pity laurie isnt here to help us began jo as they sat down to icecream and salad for the second time in two days a warning look from her mother checked any further remarks and the whole family ate in heroic silence till mr march mildly observed salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients and evelynhere a general explosion of laughter cut short the history of sallets to the great surprise of the learned gentleman bundle everything into a basket and send it to the hummels germans like messes im sick of the sight of this and theres no reason you should all die of a surfeit because ive been a fool cried amy wiping her eyes i thought i should have died when i saw you two girls rattling about in the whatyoucallit like two little kernels in a very big nutshell and mother waiting in state to receive the throng sighed jo quite spent with laughter im very sorry you were disappointed dear but we all did our best to satisfy you said mrs march in a tone full of motherly regret i am satisfied ive done what i undertook and its not my fault that it failed i comfort myself with that said amy with a little quiver in her voice i thank you all very much for helping me and ill thank you still more if you wont allude to it for a month at least no one did for several months but the word fte always produced a general smile and lauries birthday gift to amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watchguard illustration tailpiece illustration literary lessons xxvii literary lessons fortune suddenly smiled upon jo and dropped a goodluck penny in her path not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness than did the little sum that came to her in this wise every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room put on her scribbling suit and fall into a vortex as she expressed it writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul for till that was finished she could find no peace her scribbling suit consisted of a black woollen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will and a cap of the same material adorned with a cheerful red bow into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family who during these periods kept their distance merely popping in their heads semioccasionally to ask with interest does genius burn jo they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead it was a sign that hard work was going on in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off and cast upon the floor at such times the intruder silently withdrew and not until the red bow was seen gayly erect upon the gifted brow did any one dare address jo she did not think herself a genius by any means but when the writing fit came on she gave herself up to it with entire abandon and led a blissful life unconscious of want care or bad weather while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh sleep forsook her eyes meals stood untasted day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times and made these hours worth living even if they bore no other fruit the divine afflatus usually lasted a week or two and then she emerged from her vortex hungry sleepy cross or despondent she was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort miss crocker to a lecture and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea it was a peoples course the lecture on the pyramids and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx they were early and while miss crocker set the heel of her stocking jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them on her left were two matrons with massive foreheads and bonnets to match discussing womans rights and making tatting beyond sat a pair of humble lovers artlessly holding each other by the hand a sombre spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna on her right her only neighbor was a studiouslooking lad absorbed in a newspaper it was a pictorial sheet and jo examined the work of art nearest her idly wondering what unfortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat while two infuriated young gentlemen with unnaturally small feet and big eyes were stabbing each other close by and a dishevelled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open pausing to turn a page the lad saw her looking and with boyish goodnature offered half his paper saying bluntly want to read it thats a firstrate story jo accepted it with a smile for she had never outgrown her liking for lads and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love mystery and murder for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday and when the authors invention fails a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis person leaving the other half to exult over their downfall prime isnt it asked the boy as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried returned jo amused at his admiration of the trash i should think i was a pretty lucky chap if i could she makes a good living out of such stories they say and he pointed to the name of mrs s l a n g northbury under the title of the tale do you know her asked jo with sudden interest no but i read all her pieces and i know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thicklysprinkled exclamationpoints that adorned the page guess she does she knows just what folks like and gets paid well for writing it here the lecture began but jo heard very little of it for while prof sands was prosing away about belzoni cheops scarabei and hieroglyphics she was covertly taking down the address of the paper and boldly resolving to try for the hundreddollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational story by the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke she had built up a splendid fortune for herself not the first founded upon paper and was already deep in the concoction of her story being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder she said nothing of her plan at home but fell to work next day much to the disquiet of her mother who always looked a little anxious when genius took to burning jo had never tried this style before contenting herself with very mild romances for the spread eagle her theatrical experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect and supplied plot language and costumes her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it and having located it in lisbon she wound up with an earthquake as a striking and appropriate dnouement the manuscript was privately despatched accompanied by a note modestly saying that if the tale didnt get the prize which the writer hardly dared expect she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth six weeks is a long time to wait and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret but jo did both and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away for on opening it a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry if the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellowcreature i think he would devote his leisure hours if he has any to that amusement for jo valued the letter more than the money because it was encouraging and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something though it was only to write a sensation story illustration a check for one hundred dollars a prouder young woman was seldom seen than she when having composed herself she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand the check in the other announcing that she had won the prize of course there was a great jubilee and when the story came every one read and praised it though after her father had told her that the language was good the romance fresh and hearty and the tragedy quite thrilling he shook his head and said in his unworldly way you can do better than this jo aim at the highest and never mind the money i think the money is the best part of it what will you do with such a fortune asked amy regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye send beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two answered jo promptly oh how splendid no i cant do it dear it would be so selfish cried beth who had clapped her thin hands and taken a long breath as if pining for fresh oceanbreezes then stopped herself and motioned away the check which her sister waved before her ah but you shall go ive set my heart on it thats what i tried for and thats why i succeeded i never get on when i think of myself alone so it will help me to work for you dont you see besides marmee needs the change and she wont leave you so you must go wont it be fun to see you come home plump and rosy again hurrah for dr jo who always cures her patients to the sea side they went after much discussion and though beth didnt come home as plump and rosy as could be desired she was much better while mrs march declared she felt ten years younger so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money and fell to work with a cheery spirit bent on earning more of those delightful checks she did earn several that year and began to feel herself a power in the house for by the magic of a pen her rubbish turned into comforts for them all the dukes daughter paid the butchers bill a phantom hand put down a new carpet and the curse of the coventrys proved the blessing of the marches in the way of groceries and gowns wealth is certainly a most desirable thing but poverty has its sunny side and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand and to the inspiration of necessity we owe half the wise beautiful and useful blessings of the world jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny little notice was taken of her stories but they found a market and encouraged by this fact she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune having copied her novel for the fourth time read it to all her confidential friends and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers she at last disposed of it on condition that she would cut it down one third and omit all the parts which she particularly admired now i must either bundle it back into my tinkitchen to mould pay for printing it myself or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what i can for it fame is a very good thing to have in the house but cash is more convenient so i wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject said jo calling a family council dont spoil your book my girl for there is more in it than you know and the idea is well worked out let it wait and ripen was her fathers advice and he practised as he preached having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow it seems to me that jo will profit more by making the trial than by waiting said mrs march criticism is the best test of such work for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults and help her to do better next time we are too partial but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful even if she gets but little money yes said jo knitting her brows thats just it ive been fussing over the thing so long i really dont know whether its good bad or indifferent it will be a great help to have cool impartial persons take a look at it and tell me what they think of it i wouldnt leave out a word of it youll spoil it if you do for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people and it will be all a muddle if you dont explain as you go on said meg who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written but mr allen says leave out the explanations make it brief and dramatic and let the characters tell the story interrupted jo turning to the publishers note do as he tells you he knows what will sell and we dont make a good popular book and get as much money as you can by and by when youve got a name you can afford to digress and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels said amy who took a strictly practical view of the subject well said jo laughing if my people are philosophical and metaphysical it isnt my fault for i know nothing about such things except what i hear father say sometimes if ive got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance so much the better for me now beth what do you say i should so like to see it printed soon was all beth said and smiled in saying it but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor which chilled jos heart for a minute with a foreboding fear and decided her to make her little venture soon so with spartan firmness the young authoress laid her firstborn on her table and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre in the hope of pleasing every one she took every ones advice and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description out therefore it nearly all came and with it many necessary links in the story meg admired the tragedy so jo piled up the agony to suit her while amy objected to the fun and with the best intentions in life jo quenched the sprightly scenes which relieved the sombre character of the story then to complete the ruin she cut it down one third and confidingly sent the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover you said mother that criticism would help me but how can it when its so contradictory that i dont know whether ive written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dire dismay the next this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness all is sweet pure and healthy continued the perplexed authoress the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters now as i had no theory of any kind dont believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i dont see how this critic can be right another says its one of the best american novels which has appeared for years i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book tisnt some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it for the pleasure and the money i wish id printed it whole or not at all for i do hate to be so misjudged her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally yet it was a hard time for sensitive highspirited jo who meant so well and had apparently done so ill but it did her good for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an authors best education and when the first soreness was over she could laugh at her poor little book yet believe in it still and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received not being a genius like keats it wont kill me she said stoutly and ive got the joke on my side after all for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced charmingly natural tender and true so ill comfort myself with that and when im ready ill up again and take another illustration tailpiece illustration domestic experiences xxviii domestic experiences like most other young matrons meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper john should find home a paradise he should always see a smiling face should fare sumptuously every day and never know the loss of a button she brought so much love energy and

true martha cumbered with many cares she was too tired sometimes even to smile john grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare as for buttons she soon learned

ceased to be a glorified bower but it became a home and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better at first they played keephouse and frolicked over it like children then john took steadily to business feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders and meg laid by her cambric wrappers put on a big apron and fell to work as before said with more energy than discretion while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs corneliuss receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise working out the problems with patience and care sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes or lotty would be privately despatched with a batch of failures which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little hummels an evening with john over the accountbooks usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm and a frugal fit would ensue during which the poor man was put through a course of breadpudding hash and warmedover coffee which tried his soul although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude before the golden mean was found however meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long withouta family jar fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves she undertook to put up her own currant jelly john was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once as john firmly believed that my wife was equal to anything and took a natural pride in her skill he resolved that she should be gratified and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use home came four dozen delightful little pots half a barrel of sugar and a small boy to pick the currants for her with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap arms bared to the elbow and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib the young housewife fell to work feeling no doubts about her success for hadnt she seen hannah do it hundreds of times the array of pots rather amazed her at first but john was so fond of jelly and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf that meg resolved to fill them all and spent a long day picking boiling straining and fussing over her jelly she did her best she asked advice of mrs cornelius she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she had left undone she reboiled resugared and restrained but that dreadful stuff wouldnt jell she longed to run home bib and all and ask mother to lend a hand but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy any one with their private worries experiments or quarrels they had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one but they had held to their resolve and whenever they could get on without help they did so and no one interfered for mrs march had advised the plan so meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day and at five oclock sat down in her topsyturvy kitchen wrung her bedaubed hands lifted up her voice and wept now in the first flush of the new life she had often said my husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes i shall always be prepared there shall be no flurry no scolding no discomfort but a neat house a cheerful wife and a good dinner john dear never stop to ask my leave invite whom you please and be sure of a welcome from me how charming that was to be sure john quite glowed with pride to hear her say it and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now it always happens so in this vale of tears there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at deplore and bear as we best can if john had not forgotten all about the jelly it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day of all the days in the year to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce when his pretty wife came running out to meet him he escorted his friend to his mansion with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband it is a world of disappointments as john discovered when he reached the dovecote the front door usually stood hospitably open now it was not only shut but locked and yesterdays mud still adorned the steps the parlorwindows were closed and curtained no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza in white with a distracting little bow in her hair or a brighteyed hostess smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest nothing of the sort for not a soul appeared but a sanguinarylooking boy asleep under the currantbushes im afraid something has happened step into the garden scott while i look up mrs brooke said john alarmed at the silence and solitude round the house he hurried led by a pungent smell of burnt sugar and mr scott strolled after him with a queer look on his face he paused discreetly at a distance when brooke disappeared but he could both see and hear and being a bachelor enjoyed the prospect mightily in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot another lay upon the floor and a third was burning gayly on the stove lotty with teutonic phlegm was calmly eating bread and currant wine for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state while mrs brooke with her apron over her head sat sobbing dismally my dearest girl what is the matter cried john rushing in with awful visions of scalded hands sudden news of affliction and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden o john i am so tired and hot and cross and worried ive been at it till im all worn out do come and help me or i shall die and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor what worries you dear has anything dreadful happened asked the anxious john tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap which was all askew yes sobbed meg despairingly tell me quick then dont cry i can bear anything better than that out with it love thethe jelly wont jell and i dont know what to do john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal which put the finishing stroke to poor megs woe is that all fling it out of window and dont bother any more about it ill buy you quarts if you want it but for heavens sake dont have hysterics for ive brought jack scott home to dinner and john got no further for meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay a man to dinner and everything in a mess john brooke how could you do such a thing hush hes in the garden i forgot the confounded jelly but it cant be helped now said john surveying the prospect with an anxious eye you ought to have sent word or told me this morning and you ought to have remembered how busy i was continued meg petulantly for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled i didnt know it this morning and there was no time to send word for i met him on the way out i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked i never tried it before and hang me if i ever do again added john with an aggrieved air i should hope not take him away at once i cant see him and there isnt any dinner well i like that wheres the beef and vegetables i sent home and the pudding you promised cried john rushing to the larder i hadnt time to cook anything i meant to dine at mothers im sorry but i was so busy and megs tears began again john was a mild man but he was human and after a long days work to come home tired hungry and hopeful to find a chaotic house an empty table and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner he restrained himself however and the little squall would have blown over but for one unlucky word its a scrape i acknowledge but if you will lend a hand well pull through and have a good time yet dont cry dear but just exert yourself a bit and knock us up something to eat were both as hungry as hunters so we shant mind what it is give us the cold meat and bread and cheese we wont ask for jelly he meant it for a goodnatured joke but that one word sealed his fate meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke you must get yourself out of the scrape as you can im too used up to exert myself for any one its like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company i wont have anything of the sort in my house take that scott up to mothers and tell him im away sick deadanything i wont see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like you wont have anything else here and having delivered her defiance all in one breath meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room what those two creatures did in her absence she never knew but mr scott was not taken up to mothers and when meg descended after they had strolled away together she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror lotty reported that they had eaten a much and greatly laughed and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff and hide the pots meg longed to go and tell mother but a sense of shame at her own shortcomings of loyalty to john who might be cruel but nobody should know it restrained her and after a summary clearing up she dressed herself prettily and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven unfortunately john didnt come not seeing the matter in that light he had carried it off as a good joke with scott excused his little wife as well as he could and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner and promised to come again but john was angry though he did not show it he felt that meg had got him into a scrape and then deserted him in his hour of need it wasnt fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time with perfect freedom and when he took you at your word to flame up and blame him and leave him in the lurch to be laughed at or pitied no by george it wasnt and meg must know it he had fumed inwardly during the feast but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing scott off a milder mood came over him poor little thing it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me she was wrong of course but then she was young i must be patient and teach her he hoped she had not gone homehe hated gossip and interference for a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it and then the fear that meg would cry herself sick softened his heart and sent him on at a quicker pace resolving to be calm and kind but firm quite firm and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse meg likewise resolved to be calm and kind but firm and show him his duty she longed to run to meet him and beg pardon and be kissed and comforted as she was sure of being but of course she did nothing of the sort and when she saw john coming began to hum quite naturally as she rocked and sewed like a lady of leisure in her best parlor john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology he made none only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark we are going to have a new moon my dear ive no objection was megs equally soothing remark a few other topics of general interest were introduced by mr brooke and wetblanketed by mrs brooke and conversation languished john went to one window unfolded his paper and wrapped himself in it figuratively speaking meg went to the other window and sewed as if new rosettes for her slippers were among the necessaries of life neither spoke both looked quite calm and firm and both felt desperately uncomfortable illustration both felt desperately uncomfortable oh dear thought meg married life is very trying and does need infinite patience as well as love as mother says the word mother suggested other maternal counsels given long ago and received with unbelieving protests john is a good man but he has his faults and you must learn to see and bear with them remembering your own he is very decided but never will be obstinate if you reason kindly not oppose impatiently he is very accurate and particular about the trutha good trait though you call him fussy never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need he has a temper not like oursone flash and then all overbut the white still anger that is seldom stirred but once kindled is hard to quench be careful very careful not to wake this anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect watch yourself be the first to ask pardon if you both err and guard against the little piques misunderstandings and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last this was the first serious disagreement her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind as she recalled them her own anger looked childish now and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them she put down her work and got up thinking i will be the first to say forgive me but he did not seem to hear her she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head for a minute she felt as if she really couldnt do it then came the thought this is the beginning ill do my part and have nothing to reproach myself with and stooping down she softly kissed her husband on the forehead of course that settled it the penitent kiss was better than a world of words and john had her on his knee in a minute saying tenderly it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jellypots forgive me dear i never will again but he did oh bless you yes hundreds of times and so did meg both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made for family peace was preserved in that little family jar after this meg had mr scott to dinner by special invitation and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course on which occasion she was so gay and gracious and made everything go off so charmingly that mr scott told john he was a happy fellow and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home in the autumn new trials and experiences came to meg sallie moffat renewed her friendship was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house or inviting that poor dear to come in and spend the day at the big house it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely all were busy at home john absent till night and nothing to do but sew or read or potter about so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend seeing sallies pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them sallie was very kind and often offered her the coveted trifles but meg declined them knowing that john wouldnt like it and then this foolish little woman went and did what john disliked infinitely worse she knew her husbands income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value morehis money she knew where it was was free to take what she liked and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny pay bills once a month and remember that she was a poor mans wife till now she had done well been prudent and exact kept her little accountbooks neatly and showed them to him monthly without fear but that autumn the serpent got into megs paradise and tempted her like many a modern eve not with apples but with dress meg didnt like to be pitied and made to feel poor it irritated her but she was ashamed to confess it and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty so that sallie neednt think she had to economize she always felt wicked after it for the pretty things were seldom necessaries but then they cost so little it wasnt worth worrying about so the trifles increased unconsciously and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive lookeron but the trifles cost more than one would imagine and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her john was busy that month and left the bills to her the next month he was absent but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up and meg never forgot it a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience sallie had been buying silks and meg longed for a new onejust a handsome light one for parties her black silk was so common and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls aunt march usually gave the sisters a present of twentyfive dollars apiece at new year that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it john always said what was his was hers but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective fiveandtwenty but another fiveandtwenty out of the household fund that was the question sallie had urged her to do it had offered to loan the money and with the best intentions in life had tempted meg beyond her strength in an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely shimmering folds and said a bargain i assure you maam she answered ill take it and it was cut off and paid for and sallie had exulted and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence and driven away feeling as if she had stolen something and the police were after her illustration a bargain i assure you maam when she got home she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk but it looked less silvery now didnt become her after all and the words fifty dollars seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth she put it away but it haunted her not delightfully as a new dress should but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid when john got out his books that night megs heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but didnt mean to let her know it the housebills were all paid the books all in order john had praised her and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the bank when meg knowing that it was quite empty stopped his hand saying nervously you havent seen my private expense book yet john never asked to see it but she always insisted on his doing so and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted and made him guess what piping was demand fiercely the meaning of a hugmetight or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds a bit of velvet and a pair of strings could possibly be a bonnet and cost five or six dollars that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance as he often did being particularly proud of his prudent wife the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him meg got behind his chair under pretence of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead and standing there she said with her panic increasing with every word john dear im ashamed to show you my book for ive really been dreadfully extravagant lately i go about so much i must have things you know and sallie advised my getting it so i did and my newyears money will partly pay for it but i was sorry after id done it for i knew youd think it wrong in me john laughed and drew her round beside him saying goodhumoredly dont go and hide i wont beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots im rather proud of my wifes feet and dont mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots if they are good ones that had been one of her last trifles and johns eye had fallen on it as he spoke oh what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars thought meg with a shiver its worse than boots its a silk dress she said with the calmness of desperation for she wanted the worst over well dear what is the demd total as mr mantalini says that didnt sound like john and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now she turned the page and her head at the same time pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty but which was appalling to her with that added for a minute the room was very still then john said slowlybut she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure well i dont know that fifty is much for a dress with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days it isnt made or trimmed sighed meg faintly for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her twentyfive yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman but ive no doubt my wife will look as fine as ned moffats when she gets it on said john dryly i know you are angry john but i cant help it i dont mean to waste your money and i didnt think those little things would count up so i cant resist them when i see sallie buying all she wants and pitying me because i dont i try to be contented but it is hard and im tired of being poor the last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them but he did and they wounded him deeply for he had denied himself many pleasures for megs sake she could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it for john pushed the books away and got up saying with a little quiver in his voice i was afraid of this i do my best meg if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words she ran to him and held him close crying with repentant tears o john my dear kind hardworking boy i didnt mean it it was so wicked so untrue and ungrateful how could i say it oh how could i say it he was very kind forgave her readily and did not utter one reproach but meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon although he might never allude to it again she had promised to love him for better for worse and then she his wife had reproached him with his poverty after spending his earnings recklessly it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep a week of remorse nearly made meg sick and the discovery that john had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold he had simply said in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change i cant afford it my dear meg said no more but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat crying as if her heart would break they had a long talk that night and meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty because it seemed to have made a man of him given him the strength and courage to fight his own way and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor the goodnatured mrs moffat willingly did so and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward then meg ordered home the greatcoat and when john arrived she put it on and asked him how he liked her new silk gown one can imagine what answer he made how he received his present and what a blissful state of things ensued john came home early meg gadded no more and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife so the year rolled round and at midsummer there came to meg a new experiencethe deepest and tenderest of a womans life laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday with an excited face and was received with the clash of cymbals for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other hows the little mamma where is everybody why didnt you tell me before i came home began laurie in a loud whisper happy as a queen the dear every soul of em is upstairs a worshipin we didnt want no hurrycanes round now you go into the parlor and ill send em down to you with which somewhat involved reply hannah vanished chuckling ecstatically presently jo appeared proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow jos face was very sober but her eyes twinkled and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort shut your eyes and hold out your arms she said invitingly laurie backed precipitately into a corner and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture no thank you id rather not i shall drop it or smash it as sure as fate then you shant see your nevvy said jo decidedly turning as if to go i will i will only you must be responsible for damages and obeying orders laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms a peal of laughter from jo amy mrs march hannah and john caused him to open them the next minute to find himself invested with two babies instead of one illustration laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms no wonder they laughed for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed twins by jupiter was all he said for a minute then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous he added take em quick somebody im going to laugh and i shall drop em john rescued his babies and marched up and down with one on each arm as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending while laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks its the best joke of the season isnt it i wouldnt have you told for i set my heart on surprising you and i flatter myself ive done it said jo when she got her breath i never was more staggered in my life isnt it fun are they boys what are you going to name them lets have another look hold me up jo for upon my life its one too many for me returned laurie regarding the infants with the air of a big benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens boy and girl arent they beauties said the proud papa beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels most remarkable children i ever saw which is which and laurie bent like a wellsweep to examine the prodigies amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl french fashion so you can always tell besides one has blue eyes and one brown kiss them uncle teddy said wicked jo im afraid they mightnt like it began laurie with unusual timidity in such matters of course they will they are used to it now do it this minute sir commanded jo fearing he might propose a proxy laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh and made the babies squeal there i knew they didnt like it thats the boy see him kick he hits out with his fists like a good one now then young brooke pitch into a man of your own size will you cried laurie delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist flapping aimlessly about hes to be named john laurence and the girl margaret after mother and grandmother we shall call her daisy so as not to have two megs and i suppose the mannie will be jack unless we find a better name said amy with auntlike interest name him demijohn and call him demi for short said laurie daisy and demijust the thing i knew teddy would do it cried jo clapping her hands teddy certainly had done it that time for the babies were daisy and demi to the end of the chapter xxix calls illustration calls come jo its time for what you dont mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today ive done a good many rash and foolish things in my life but i dont think i ever was mad enough to say id make six calls in one day when a single one upsets me for a week yes you did it was a bargain between us i was to finish the crayon of beth for you and you were to go properly with me and return our neighbors visits if it was fairthat was in the bond and i stand to the letter of my bond shylock there is a pile of clouds in the east its not fair and i dont go now thats shirking its a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was mantuamaker general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelt thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you dont intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement why not im neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i dont wish to see them you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please it pays for you to be fine it doesnt for me and furbelows only worry me oh dear sighed amy now shes in a contrary fit and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready im sure its no pleasure to me to go today but its a debt we owe society and theres no one to pay it but you and me ill do anything for you jo if youll only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil you can talk so well look so aristocratic in your best things and behave so beautifully if you try that im proud of you im afraid to go alone do come and take care of me youre an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way the idea of my being aristocratic and wellbred and your being afraid to go anywhere alone i dont know which is the most absurd well ill go if i must and do my best you shall be commander of the expedition and ill obey blindly will that satisfy you said jo with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission youre a perfect cherub now put on all your best things and ill tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression i want people to like you and they would if youd only try to be a little more agreeable do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet its becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief well stop at megs and borrow her white sunshade and then you can have my dovecolored one while amy dressed she issued her orders and jo obeyed them not without entering her protest however for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel as the last touch of elegance she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance saying meekly im perfectly miserable but if you consider me presentable i die happy you are highly satisfactory turn slowly round and let me get a careful view jo revolved and amy gave a touch here and there then fell back with her head on one side observing graciously yes youll do your head is all i could ask for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing hold back your shoulders and carry your hands easily no matter if your gloves do pinch theres one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawli cant but its very nice to see you and im so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one its simple but handsome and those folds over the arm are really artistic is the point of my mantle in the middle and have i looped my dress evenly i like to show my boots for my feet are pretty though my nose isnt you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever said jo looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the gold hair am i to drag my best dress through the dust or loop it up please maam hold it up when you walk but drop it in the house the sweeping style suits you best and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully you havent half buttoned one cuff do it at once youll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details for they make up the pleasing whole jo sighed and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove in doing up her cuff but at last both were ready and sailed away looking as pretty as picters hannah said as she hung out of the upper window to watch them now jo dear the chesters consider themselves very elegant people so i want you to put on your best deportment dont make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you just be calm cool and quietthats safe and ladylike and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes said amy as they approached the first place having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by meg with a baby on each arm let me see calm cool and quietyes i think i can promise that ive played the part of a prim young lady on the stage and ill try it off my powers are great as you shall see so be easy in your mind my child amy looked relieved but naughty jo took her at her word for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed every fold correctly draped calm as a summer sea cool as a snowbank and as silent as a sphinx in vain mrs chester alluded to her charming novel and the misses chester introduced parties picnics the opera and the fashions each and all were answered by a smile a bow and a demure yes or no with the chill on in vain amy telegraphed the word talk tried to draw her out and administered covert pokes with her foot jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all with deportment like mauds face icily regular splendidly null what a haughty uninteresting creature that oldest miss march is was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies as the door closed upon their guests jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall but amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions and very naturally laid the blame upon jo how could you mistake me so i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone try to be sociable at the lambs gossip as other girls do and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up they move in the best society are valuable persons for us to know and i wouldnt fail to make a good impression there for anything ill be agreeable ill gossip and giggle and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like i rather enjoy this and now ill imitate what is called a charming girl i can do it for i have may chester as a model and ill improve upon her see if the lambs dont say what a lively nice creature that jo march is amy felt anxious as well she might for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop amys face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawingroom kiss all the young ladies with effusion beam graciously upon the young gentlemen and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder amy was taken possession of by mrs lamb with whom she was a favorite and forced to hear a long account of lucretias last attack while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her so situated she was powerless to check jo who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief and talked away as volubly as the old lady a knot of heads gathered about her and amy strained her ears to hear what was going on for broken sentences filled her with alarm round eyes and uplifted hands tormented her with curiosity and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun one may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation she rides splendidlywho taught her no one she used to practise mounting holding the reins and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree now she rides anything for she doesnt know what fear is and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well she has such a passion for it i often tell her if everything else fails she can be a horsebreaker and get her living so at this awful speech amy contained herself with difficulty for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady which was her especial aversion but what could she do for the old lady was in the middle of her story and long before it was done jo was off again making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders yes amy was in despair that day for all the good beasts were gone and of three left one was lame one blind and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start nice animal for a pleasure party wasnt it which did she choose asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject none of them she heard of a young horse at the farmhouse over the river and though a lady had never ridden him she resolved to try because he was handsome and spirited her struggles were really pathetic there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse my dear creature she actually rowed it over the river put it on her head and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man illustration she took the saddle to the horse did she ride the horse of course she did and had a capital time i expected to see her brought home in fragments but she managed him perfectly and was the life of the party well i call that plucky and young mr lamb turned an approving glance upon amy wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable she was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago must needs answer with unnecessary frankness oh amy painted it you cant buy those soft shades so we paint ours any color we like its a great comfort to have an artistic sister isnt that an original idea cried miss lamb who found jo great fun thats nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances theres nothing the child cant do why she wanted a pair of blue boots for sallies party so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of skyblue you ever saw and they looked exactly like satin added jo with an air of pride in her sisters accomplishments that exasperated amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her we read a story of yours the other day and enjoyed it very much observed the elder miss lamb wishing to compliment the literary lady who did not look the character just then it must be confessed any mention of her works always had a bad effect upon jo who either grew rigid and looked offended or changed the subject with a brusque remark as now sorry you could find nothing better to read i write that rubbish because it sells and ordinary people like it are you going to new york this winter as miss lamb had enjoyed the story this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary the minute it was made jo saw her mistake but fearing to make the matter worse suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure and did so with an abruptness that left three people with halffinished sentences in their mouths amy we must go goodby dear do come and see us we are pining for a visit i dont dare to ask you mr lamb but if you should come i dont think i shall have the heart to send you away jo said this with such a droll imitation of may chesters gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time didnt i do that well asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away nothing could have been worse was amys crushing reply what possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle and the hats and boots and all the rest of it why its funny and amuses people they know we are poor so its no use pretending that we have grooms buy three or four hats a season and have things as easy and fine as they do you neednt go and tell them all our little shifts and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way you havent a bit of proper pride and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak said amy despairingly poor jo looked abashed and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors how shall i behave here she asked as they approached the third mansion just as you please i wash my hands of you was amys short answer then ill enjoy myself the boys are at home and well have a comfortable time goodness knows i need a little change for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution returned jo gruffly being disturbed by her failures to suit an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr tudor who happened to be calling likewise jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing she listened to college stories with deep interest caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur agreed heartily that tom brown was a brick regardless of the improper form of praise and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtletank she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to smile upon her as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs bearlike but affectionate and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired frenchwoman leaving her sister to her own devices amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her hearts content mr tudors uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord and amy regarded the whole family with great respect for in spite of her american birth and breeding she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of usthat unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in a ferment at the coming of a royal yellowhaired laddie some years ago and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old like that of a big son for an imperious little mother who held him while she could and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time and when the proper number of minutes had passed she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society and looked about for jo fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march illustration it might have been worse it might have been worse but amy considered it bad for jo sat on the grass with an encampment of boys about her and a dirtyfooted dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress as she related one of lauries pranks to her admiring audience one small child was poking turtles with amys cherished parasol a second was eating gingerbread over jos best bonnet and a third playing ball with her gloves but all were enjoying themselves and when jo collected her damaged property to go her escort accompanied her begging her to come again it was such fun to hear about lauries larks capital boys arent they i feel quite young and brisk again after that said jo strolling along with her hands behind her partly from habit partly to conceal the bespattered parasol why do you always avoid mr tudor asked amy wisely refraining from any comment upon jos dilapidated appearance dont like him he puts on airs snubs his sisters worries his father and doesnt speak respectfully of his mother laurie says he is fast and i dont consider him a desirable acquaintance so i let him alone you might treat him civilly at least you gave him a cool nod and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to tommy chamberlain whose father keeps a grocery store if you had just reversed the nod and the bow it would have been right said amy reprovingly no it wouldnt returned perverse jo i neither like respect nor admire tudor though his grandfathers uncles nephews niece was third cousin to a lord tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever i think well of him and like to show that i do for he is a gentleman in spite of the brownpaper parcels its no use trying to argue with you began amy not the least my dear interrupted jo so let us look amiable and drop a card here as the kings are evidently out for which im deeply grateful the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house and being told that the young ladies were engaged now let us go home and never mind aunt march today we can run down there any time and its really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers when we are tired and cross speak for yourself if you please aunt likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style and making a formal call its a little thing to do but it gives her pleasure and i dont believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them stoop down and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet what a good girl you are amy said jo with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister which was fresh and spotless still i wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you i think of them but it takes too much time to do them so i wait for a chance to confer a great favor and let the small ones slip but they tell best in the end i fancy amy smiled and was mollified at once saying with a maternal air women should learn to be agreeable particularly poor ones for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive if youd remember that and practise it youd be better liked than i am because there is more of you im a crotchety old thing and always shall be but im willing to own that you are right only its easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i dont feel like it its a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes isnt it its a greater not to be able to hide them i dont mind saying that i dont approve of tudor any more than you do but im not called upon to tell him so neither are you and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is but i think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men and how can they do it except by their manners preaching does not do any good as i know to my sorrow since ive had teddy to manage but there are many little ways in which i can influence him without a word and i say we ought to do it to others if we can teddy is a remarkable boy and cant be taken as a sample of other boys said amy in a tone of solemn conviction which would have convulsed the remarkable boy if he had heard it if we were belles or women of wealth and position we might do something perhaps but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we dont approve of them and smile upon another set because we do wouldnt have a particle of effect and we should only be considered odd and puritanical so we are to countenance things and people which we detest merely because we are not belles and millionaires are we thats a nice sort of morality i cant argue about it i only know that its the way of the world and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains i dont like reformers and i hope you will never try to be one i do like them and i shall be one if i can for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them we cant agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new you will get on the best but i shall have the liveliest time of it i should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting i think well compose yourself now and dont worry aunt with your new ideas ill try not to but im always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her its my doom and i cant help it they found aunt carrol with the old lady both absorbed in some very interesting subject but they dropped it as the girls came in with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces jo was not in a good humor and the perverse fit returned but amy who had virtuously done her duty kept her temper and pleased everybody was in a most angelic frame of mind this amiable spirit was felt at once and both the aunts my deared her affectionately looking what they afterwards said emphaticallythat child improves every day are you going to help about the fair dear asked mrs carrol as amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young yes aunt mrs chester asked me if i would and i offered to tend a table as i have nothing but my time to give im not put in jo decidedly i hate to be patronized and the chesters think its a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair i wonder you consented amy they only want you to work i am willing to work its for the freedmen as well as the chesters and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant quite right and proper i like your grateful spirit my dear its a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts some do not and that is trying observed aunt march looking over her spectacles at jo who sat apart rocking herself with a somewhat morose expression illustration the call at aunt marchs if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them she would have turned dovelike in a minute but unfortunately we dont have windows in our breasts and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper by her next speech jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue i dont like favors they oppress and make me feel like a slave id rather do everything for myself and be perfectly independent ahem coughed aunt carrol softly with a look at aunt march i told you so said aunt march with a decided nod to aunt carrol mercifully unconscious of what she had done jo sat with her nose in the air and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting do you speak french dear asked mrs carrol laying her hand on amys pretty well thanks to aunt march who lets esther talk to me as often as i like replied amy with a grateful look which caused the old lady to smile affably how are you about languages asked mrs carrol of jo dont know a word im very stupid about studying anything cant bear french its such a slippery silly sort of language was the brusque reply another look passed between the ladies and aunt march said to amy you are quite strong and well now dear i believe eyes dont trouble you any more do they not at all thank you maam im very well and mean to do great things next winter so that i may be ready for rome whenever that joyful time arrives good girl you deserve to go and im sure you will some day said aunt march with an approving pat on the head as amy picked up her ball for her crosspatch draw the latch sit by the fire and spin squalled polly bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into jos face with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing most observing bird said the old lady come and take a walk my dear cried polly hopping toward the chinacloset with a look suggestive of lumpsugar thank you i will come amy and jo brought the visit to an end feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution she shook hands in a gentlemanly manner but amy kissed both the aunts and the girls departed leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine which impression caused aunt march to say as they vanished youd better do it mary ill supply the money and aunt carrol to reply decidedly i certainly will if her father and mother consent illustration tailpiece illustration you shall have another table xxx consequences mrs chesters fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and every one was much interested in the matter amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but amys talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the arttable and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some five and twenty women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling amys dainty penandink work entirely eclipsed mays painted vasesthat was one thorn then the allconquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with maythat was thorn number two but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave her an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape no hint of this had reached the culprits however and amys dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to any one but my girls as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief gettersup of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place im sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like mrs chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with amys unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble amy felt that there was something behind this but could not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all now my dear dont have any ill feeling i beg its merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere wouldnt you like the flowertable the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged you could make a charming thing of it and the flowertable is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability it shall be as you please mrs chester ill give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little consciencestricken as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron pellmell she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness now shes mad oh dear i wish i hadnt asked you to speak mamma said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically but everything seemed against her it was late and she was tired every one was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order the evergreen arch wouldnt stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled her best tile got a splash of water which left a sepia tear on the cupids cheek she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draught which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow any girlreader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through with her task there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right beth declared she wouldnt go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she didnt take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her because they are mean is no reason why i should be i hate such things and though i think ive a right to be hurt i dont intend to show it they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions wont they marmee thats the right spirit my dear a kiss for a blow is always best though its not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practising in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in an anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet productiona little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of goodwill helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself i ought but i dont thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to mays discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home even a fairtable may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season amys conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always dotook the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice a group of girls were standing about mays table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it she heard may say sorrowfully its too bad for there is no time to make other things and i dont want to fill up with odds and ends the table was just complete then now its spoilt i dare say shed put them back if you asked her suggested some one how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for amys voice came across the hall saying pleasantly you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them i was just thinking id offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it now i call that lovely of her dont you cried one girl mays answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she wouldnt sell them at her own table now that was hard when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its own reward but it isas she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skilful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly it was a very long day and a hard one to amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night the arttable was the most attractive in the room there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling moneyboxes amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of being found there in the evening by her family and laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea beth helped her dress and made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned dont do anything rude pray jo i wont have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible teddy and his boys will lend a hand and well have a good time yet returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him is that my boy as sure as this is my girl and laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified o teddy such doings and jo told amys wrongs with sisterly zeal a flock of our fellows are going to drive over by and by and ill be hanged if i dont make them buy every flower shes got and camp down before her table afterward said laurie espousing her cause with warmth the flowers are not at all nice amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time i dont wish to be unjust or suspicious but i shouldnt wonder if they never came at all when people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed jo in a disgusted tone didnt hayes give you the best out of our gardens i told him to i didnt know that he forgot i suppose and as your grandpa was poorly i didnt like to worry him by asking though i did want some now jo how could you think there was any need of asking they are just as much yours as mine dont we always go halves in everything began laurie in the tone that always made jo turn thorny gracious i hope not half of some of your things wouldnt suit me at all but we mustnt stand philandering here ive got to help amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if youll be so very kind as to let hayes take a few nice flowers up to the hall ill bless you forever couldnt you do it now asked laurie so suggestively that jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars go away teddy im busy thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a lovely basket arranged in his best manner for a centrepiece then the march family turned out en masse and jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring amys taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as sprightly and gracious as possiblecoming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was its own reward after all illustration bought up the bouquets jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor jo circulated about the hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the chester change of base she reproached herself for her share of the illfeeling and resolved to exonerate amy as soon as possible she also discovered what amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity as she passed the arttable she glanced over it for her sisters things but saw no signs of them tucked away out of sight i dare say thought jo who could forgive her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered to her family good evening miss jo how does amy get on asked may with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could be generous she has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself the flowertable is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen jo couldnt resist giving that little slap but may took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold is amys illumination anywhere about i took a fancy to buy that for father said jo very anxious to learn the fate of her sisters work everything of amys sold long ago i took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned may who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as amy that day much gratified jo rushed back to tell the good news and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of mays words and manner now gentlemen i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mineespecially the arttable she said ordering out teddys own as the girls called the college friends charge chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and youll get your moneys worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field to hear is to obey but march is fairer far than may said little parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by laurie who said very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head buy the vases whispered amy to laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemys head to mays great delight mr laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases aunt carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to mrs march in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later the fair was pronounced a success and when may bade amy good night she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget that satisfied amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimneypiece with a great bouquet in each the reward of merit for a magnanimous march as laurie announced with a flourish youve a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than i ever gave you credit for amy youve behaved sweetly and i respect you with all my heart said jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive it must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things i dont believe i could have done it as kindly as you did added beth from her pillow why girls you neednt praise me so i only did as id be done by you laugh at me when i say i want to be a lady but i mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and i try to do it as far as i know how i cant explain exactly but i want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women im far from it now but i do my best and hope in time to be what mother is amy spoke earnestly and jo said with a cordial hug i understand now what you mean and ill never laugh at you again you are getting on faster than you think and ill take lessons of you in true politeness for youve learned the secret i believe try away deary youll get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than i shall a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted a letter came from aunt carrol and mrs marchs face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that jo and beth who were with her demanded what the glad tidings were aunt carrol is going abroad next month and wants me to go with her burst in jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture no dear not you its amy o mother shes too young its my turn first ive wanted it so longit would do me so much good and be so altogether splendidi must go im afraid its impossible jo aunt says amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor its always so amy has all the fun and i have all the work it isnt fair oh it isnt fair cried jo passionately im afraid it is partly your own fault dear when aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had saidi planned at first to ask jo but as favors burden her and she hates french i think i wont venture to invite her amy is more docile will make a good companion for flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her oh my tongue my abominable tongue why cant i learn to keep it quiet groaned jo remembering words which had been her undoing when she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases mrs march said sorrowfully i wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and dont sadden amys pleasure by reproaches or regrets ill try said jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset ill take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness but it wont be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears jo dear im very selfish but i couldnt spare you and im glad you are not going quite yet whispered beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg aunt carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it by the time amy came in jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at amys good fortune the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself it isnt a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette it will decide my career for if i have any genius i shall find it out in rome and will do something to prove it suppose you havent said jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy then i shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure but she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes no you wont you hate hard work and youll marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said jo your predictions sometimes come to pass but i dont believe that one will im sure i wish it would for if i cant be an artist myself i should like to be able to help those who are said amy smiling as if the part of lady bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawingteacher hum said jo with a sigh if you wish it youll have it for your wishes are always grantedmine never would you like to go asked amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife rather well in a year or two ill send for you and well dig in the forum for relics and carry out all the plans weve made so many times thank you ill remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could there was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till amy was off jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she couldnt cry any more amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen i will dear i will and if anything happens ill come and comfort you whispered laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word so amy sailed away to find the old world which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happyhearted girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea illustration tailpiece illustration flo and i ordered a hansomcab xxxi our foreign correspondent london dearest people here i really sit at a front window of the bath hotel piccadilly its not a fashionable place but uncle stopped here years ago and wont go anywhere else however we dont mean to stay long so its no great matter oh i cant begin to tell you how i enjoy it all i never can so ill only give you bits out of my notebook for ive done nothing but sketch and scribble since i started i sent a line from halifax when i felt pretty miserable but after that i got on delightfully seldom ill on deck all day with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me every one was very kind to me especially the officers dont laugh jo gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship to hold on to or to wait upon one and as they have nothing to do its a mercy to make them useful otherwise they would smoke themselves to death im afraid illustration every one was very kind especially the officerspage 378 aunt and flo were poorly all the way and liked to be let alone so when i had done what i could for them i went and enjoyed myself such walks on deck such sunsets such splendid air and waves it was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse when we went rushing on so grandly i wish beth could have come it would have done her so much good as for jo she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib or whatever the high thing is called made friends with the engineers and tooted on the captains speakingtrumpet shed have been in such a state of rapture it was all heavenly but i was glad to see the irish coast and found it very lovely so green and sunny with brown cabins here and there ruins on some of the hills and gentlemens countryseats in the valleys with deer feeding in the parks it was early in the morning but i didnt regret getting up to see it for the bay was full of little boats the shore so picturesque and a rosy sky overhead i never shall forget it at queenstown one of my new acquaintances left usmr lennoxand when i said something about the lakes of killarney he sighed and sung with a look at me oh have you eer heard of kate kearney she lives on the banks of killarney from the glance of her eye shun danger and fly for fatals the glance of kate kearney wasnt that nonsensical we only stopped at liverpool a few hours its a dirty noisy place and i was glad to leave it uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves some ugly thick shoes and an umbrella and got shaved la muttonchop the first thing then he flattered himself that he looked like a true briton but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes the little bootblack knew that an american stood in them and said with a grin there yer har sir ive give em the latest yankee shine it amused uncle immensely oh i must tell you what that absurd lennox did he got his friend ward who came on with us to order a bouquet for me and the first thing i saw in my room was a lovely one with robert lennoxs compliments on the card wasnt that fun girls i like travelling i never shall get to london if i dont hurry the trip was like riding through a long picturegallery full of lovely landscapes the farmhouses were my delight with thatched roofs ivy up to the eaves latticed windows and stout women with rosy children at the doors the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours as they stood kneedeep in clover and the hens had a contented cluck as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies such perfect color i never sawthe grass so green sky so blue grain so yellow woods so darki was in a rapture all the way so was flo and we kept bouncing from one side to the other trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour aunt was tired and went to sleep but uncle read his guidebook and wouldnt be astonished at anything this is the way we went on amy flying upoh that must be kenilworth that gray place among the trees flo darting to my windowhow sweet we must go there some time wont we papa uncle calmly admiring his bootsno my dear not unless you want beer thats a brewery a pausethen flo cried out bless me theres a gallows and a man going up where where shrieks amy staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains a colliery remarks uncle with a twinkle of the eye heres a lovely flock of lambs all lying down says amy see papa arent they pretty added flo sentimentally geese young ladies returns uncle in a tone that keeps us quiet till flo settles down to enjoy the flirtations of capt cavendish and i have the scenery all to myself of course it rained when we got to london and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas we rested unpacked and shopped a little between the showers aunt mary got me some new things for i came off in such a hurry i wasnt half ready a white hat and blue feather a muslin dress to match and the loveliest mantle you ever saw shopping in regent street is perfectly splendid things seem so cheapnice ribbons only sixpence a yard i laid in a stock but shall get my gloves in paris doesnt that sound sort of elegant and rich flo and i for the fun of it ordered a hansom cab while aunt and uncle were out and went for a drive though we learned afterward that it wasnt the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone it was so droll for when we were shut in by the wooden apron the man drove so fast that flo was frightened and told me to stop him but he was up outside behind somewhere and i couldnt get at him he didnt hear me call nor see me flap my parasol in front and there we were quite helpless rattling away and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace at last in my despair i saw a little door in the roof and on poking it open a red eye appeared and a beery voice said now then mum i gave my order as soberly as i could and slamming down the door with an aye aye mum the man made his horse walk as if going to a funeral i poked again and said a little faster then off he went helterskelter as before and we resigned ourselves to our fate today was fair and we went to hyde park close by for we are more aristocratic than we look the duke of devonshire lives near i often see his footmen lounging at the back gate and the duke of wellingtons house is not far off such sights as i saw my dear it was as good as punch for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches with gorgeous jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats up behind and powdered coachmen in front smart maids with the rosiest children i ever saw handsome girls looking half asleep dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about and tall soldiers in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side looking so funny i longed to sketch them rotten row means route de roi or the kings way but now its more like a ridingschool than anything else the horses are splendid and the men especially the grooms ride well but the women are stiff and bounce which isnt according to our rules i longed to show them a tearing american gallop for they trotted solemnly up and down in their scant habits and high hats looking like the women in a toy noahs ark every one ridesold men stout ladies little childrenand the young folks do a deal of flirting here i saw a pair exchange rosebuds for its the thing to wear one in the buttonhole and i thought it rather a nice little idea in the pm to westminster abbey but dont expect me to describe it thats impossibleso ill only say it was sublime this evening we are going to see fechter which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life midnight its very late but i cant let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening who do you think came in as we were at tea lauries english friends fred and frank vaughn i was so surprised for i shouldnt have known them but for the cards both are tall fellows with whiskers fred handsome in the english style and frank much better for he only limps slightly and uses no crutches they had heard from laurie where we were to be and came to ask us to their house but uncle wont go so we shall return the call and see them as we can they went to the theatre with us and we did have such a good time for frank devoted himself to flo and fred and i talked over past present and future fun as if we had known each other all our days tell beth frank asked for her and was sorry to hear of her ill health fred laughed when i spoke of jo and sent his respectful compliments to the big hat neither of them had forgotten camp laurence or the fun we had there what ages ago it seems doesnt it aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time so i must stop i really feel like a dissipated london fine lady writing here so late with my room full of pretty things and my head a jumble of parks theatres new gowns and gallant creatures who say ah and twirl their blond mustaches with the true english lordliness i long to see you all and in spite of my nonsense am as ever your loving amy dear girls paris in my last i told you about our london visithow kind the vaughns were and what pleasant parties they made for us i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything elsefor at hampton i saw raphaels cartoons and at the museum rooms full of pictures by turner lawrence reynolds hogarth and the other great creatures the day in richmond park was charming for we had a regular english picnic and i had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than i could copy also heard a nightingale and saw larks go up we did london to our hearts content thanks to fred and frank and were sorry to go away for though english people are slow to take you in when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality i think the vaughns hope to meet us in rome next winter and i shall be dreadfully disappointed if they dont for grace and i are great friends and the boys very nice fellowsespecially fred well we were hardly settled here when he turned up again saying he had come for a holiday and was going to switzerland aunt looked sober at first but he was so cool about it she couldnt say a word and now we get on nicely and are very glad he came for he speaks french like a native and i dont know what we should do without him uncle doesnt know ten words and insists on talking english very loud as if that would make people understand him aunts pronunciation is oldfashioned and flo and i though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal find we dont and are very grateful to have fred do the parley vooing as uncle calls it such delightful times as we are having sightseeing from morning till night stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafs and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures rainy days i spend in the louvre revelling in pictures jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest because she has no soul for art but i have and im cultivating eye and taste as fast as i can she would like the relics of great people better for ive seen her napoleons cocked hat and gray coat his babys cradle and his old toothbrush also marie antoinettes little shoe the ring of saint denis charlemagnes sword and many other interesting things ill talk for hours about them when i come but havent time to write the palais royale is a heavenly placeso full of bijouterie and lovely things that im nearly distracted because i cant buy them fred wanted to get me some but of course i didnt allow it then the bois and the champs elyses are trs magnifique ive seen the imperial family several timesthe emperor an ugly hardlooking man the empress pale and pretty but dressed in bad taste i thoughtpurple dress green hat and yellow gloves little nap is a handsome boy who sits chatting to his tutor and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his fourhorse barouche with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind illustration ive seen the imperial family several times we often walk in the tuileries gardens for they are lovely though the antique luxembourg gardens suit me better pre la chaise is very curious for many of the tombs are like small rooms and looking in one sees a table with images or pictures of the dead and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament that is so frenchy our rooms are on the rue de rivoli and sitting in the balcony we look up and down the long brilliant street it is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our days work to go out fred is very entertaining and is altogether the most agreeable young man i ever knewexcept laurie whose manners are more charming i wish fred was dark for i dont fancy light men however the vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family so i wont find fault with their yellow hair as my own is yellower next week we are off to germany and switzerland and as we shall travel fast i shall only be able to give you hasty letters i keep my diary and try to remember correctly and describe clearly all that i see and admire as father advised it is good practice for me and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles adieu i embrace you tenderly votre amie my dear mamma heidelberg having a quiet hour before we leave for berne ill try to tell you what has happened for some of it is very important as you will see the sail up the rhine was perfect and i just sat and enjoyed it with all my might get fathers old guidebooks and read about it i havent words beautiful enough to describe it at coblentz we had a lovely time for some students from bonn with whom fred got acquainted on the boat gave us a serenade it was a moonlight night and about one oclock flo and i were waked by the most delicious music under our windows we flew up and hid behind the curtains but sly peeps showed us fred and the students singing away down below it was the most romantic thing i ever sawthe river the bridge of boats the great fortress opposite moonlight everywhere and music fit to melt a heart of stone when they were done we threw down some flowers and saw them scramble for them kiss their hands to the invisible ladies and go laughing awayto smoke and drink beer i suppose next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vestpocket and looked very sentimental i laughed at him and said i didnt throw it but flo which seemed to disgust him for he tossed it out of the window and turned sensible again im afraid im going to have trouble with that boy it begins to look like it the baths at nassau were very gay so was badenbaden where fred lost some money and i scolded him he needs some one to look after him when frank is not with him kate said once she hoped hed marry soon and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him frankfort was delightful i saw goethes house schillers statue and danneckers famous ariadne it was very lovely but i should have enjoyed it more if i had known the story better i didnt like to ask as every one knew it or pretended they did i wish jo would tell me all about it i ought to have read more for i find i dont know anything and it mortifies me now comes the serious partfor it happened here and fred is just gone he has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him i never thought of anything but a travelling friendship till the serenade night since then ive begun to feel that the moonlight walks balcony talks and daily adventures were something more to him than fun i havent flirted mother truly but remembered what you said to me and have done my very best i cant help it if people like me i dont try to make them and it worries me if i dont care for them though jo says i havent got any heart now i know mother will shake her head and the girls say oh the mercenary little wretch but ive made up my mind and if fred asks me i shall accept him though im not madly in love i like him and we get on comfortably together he is handsome young clever enough and very richever so much richer than the laurences i dont think his family would object and i should be very happy for they are all kind wellbred generous people and they like me fred as the eldest twin will have the estate i suppose and such a splendid one as it is a city house in a fashionable street not so showy as our big houses but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury such as english people believe in i like it for its genuine ive seen the plate the family jewels the old servants and pictures of the country place with its park great house lovely grounds and fine horses oh it would be all i should ask and id rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily and find nothing behind i may be mercenary but i hate poverty and dont mean to bear it a minute longer than i can help one of us must marry well meg didnt jo wont beth cant yet so i shall and make everything cosey all round i wouldnt marry a man i hated or despised you may be sure of that and though fred is not my model hero he does very well and in time i should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me and let me do just as i liked so ive been turning the matter over in my mind the last week for it was impossible to help seeing that fred liked me he said nothing but little things showed it he never goes with flo always gets on my side of the carriage table or promenade looks sentimental when we are alone and frowns at any one else who ventures to speak to me yesterday at dinner when an austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his frienda rakishlooking baronabout ein wonderschnes blndchen fred looked as fierce as a lion and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate he isnt one of the cool stiff englishmen but is rather peppery for he has scotch blood in him as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes well last evening we went up to the castle about sunsetat least all of us but fred who was to meet us there after going to the post restante for letters we had a charming time poking about the ruins the vaults where the monster tun is and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his english wife i liked the great terrace best for the view was divine so while the rest went to see the rooms inside i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lions head on the wall with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it i felt as if id got into a romance sitting there watching the neckar rolling through the valley listening to the music of the austrian band below and waiting for my lover like a real storybook girl i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it i didnt feel blushy or quakey but quite cool and only a little excited illustration trying to sketch the graystone lions head on the wall by and by i heard freds voice and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me he looked so troubled that i forgot all about myself and asked what the matter was he said hed just got a letter begging him to come home for frank was very ill so he was going at once in the night train and only had time to say goodby i was very sorry for him and disappointed for myself but only for a minute because he said as he shook handsand said it in a way that i could not mistakei shall soon come back you wont forget me amy i didnt promise but i looked at him and he seemed satisfied and there was no time for anything but messages and goodbyes for he was off in an hour and we all miss him very much i know he wanted to speak but i think from something he once hinted that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet awhile for he is a rash boy and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughterinlaw we shall soon meet in rome and then if i dont change my mind ill say yes thank you when he says will you please of course this is all very private but i wished you to know what was going on dont be anxious about me remember i am your prudent amy and be sure i will do nothing rashly send me as much advice as you like ill use it if i can i wish i could see you for a good talk marmee love and trust me ever your amy xxxii tender troubles jo im anxious about beth why mother she has seemed unusually well since the babies came its not her health that troubles me now its her spirits im sure there is something on her mind and i want you to discover what it is what makes you think so mother she sits alone a good deal and doesnt talk to her father as much as she used i found her crying over the babies the other day when she sings the songs are always sad ones and now and then i see a look in her face that i dont understand this isnt like beth and it worries me have you asked her about it i have tried once or twice but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that i stopped i never force my childrens confidence and i seldom have to wait for it long mrs march glanced at jo as she spoke but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but beths and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute jo said i think she is growing up and so begins to dream dreams and have hopes and fears and fidgets without knowing why or being able to explain them why mother beths eighteen but we dont realize it and treat her like a child forgetting shes a woman so she is dear heart how fast you do grow up returned her mother with a sigh and a smile cant be helped marmee so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries and let your birds hop out of the nest one by one i promise never to hop very far if that is any comfort to you it is a great comfort jo i always feel strong when you are at home now meg is gone beth is too feeble and amy too young to depend upon but when the tug comes you are always ready why you know i dont mind hard jobs much and there must always be one scrub in a family amy is splendid in fine works and im not but i feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up or half the family fall sick at once amy is distinguishing herself abroad but if anything is amiss at home im your man i leave beth to your hands then for she will open her tender little heart to her jo sooner than to any one else be very kind and dont let her think any one watches or talks about her if she only would get quite strong and cheerful again i shouldnt have a wish in the world happy woman ive got heaps my dear what are they ill settle bethys troubles and then ill tell you mine they are not very wearing so theyll keep and jo stitched away with a wise nod which set her mothers heart at rest about her for the present at least while apparently absorbed in her own affairs jo watched beth and after many conflicting conjectures finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her a slight incident gave jo the clue to the mystery she thought and lively fancy loving heart did the rest she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon when she and beth were alone together yet as she scribbled she kept her eye on her sister who seemed unusually quiet sitting at the window beths work often dropped into her lap and she leaned her head upon her hand in a dejected attitude while her eyes rested on the dull autumnal landscape suddenly some one passed below whistling like an operatic blackbird and a voice called out illustration she leaned her head upon her hands all serene coming in tonight beth started leaned forward smiled and nodded watched the passerby till his quick tramp died away then said softly as if to herself how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks hum said jo still intent upon her sisters face for the bright color faded as quickly as it came the smile vanished and presently a tear lay shining on the windowledge beth whisked it off and glanced apprehensively at jo but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate apparently engrossed in olympias oath the instant beth turned jo began her watch again saw beths hand go quietly to her eyes more than once and in her halfaverted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill fearing to betray herself she slipped away murmuring something about needing more paper mercy on me beth loves laurie she said sitting down in her own room pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made i never dreamt of such a thing what will mother say i wonder if he there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought if he shouldnt love back again how dreadful it would be he must ill make him and she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievouslooking boy laughing at her from the wall oh dear we are growing up with a vengeance heres meg married and a mamma amy flourishing away at paris and beth in love im the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said with a decided nod at the face opposite no thank you sir youre very charming but youve no more stability than a weathercock so you neednt write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way for it wont do a bit of good and i wont have it then she sighed and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations which only confirmed her suspicion though laurie flirted with amy and joked with jo his manner to beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle but so was everybodys therefore no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others indeed a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that our boy was getting fonder than ever of jo who however wouldnt hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if any one dared to suggest it if they had known the various tender passages of the past year or rather attempts at tender passages which had been nipped in the bud they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying i told you so but jo hated philandering and wouldnt allow it always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger when laurie first went to college he fell in love about once a month but these small flames were as brief as ardent did no damage and much amused jo who took great interest in the alternations of hope despair and resignation which were confided to her in their weekly conferences but there came a time when laurie ceased to worship at many shrines hinted darkly at one allabsorbing passion and indulged occasionally in byronic fits of gloom then he avoided the tender subject altogether wrote philosophical notes to jo turned studious and gave out that he was going to dig intending to graduate in a blaze of glory this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences tender pressures of the hand and eloquent glances of the eye for with jo brain developed earlier than heart and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones because when tired of them the former could be shut up in the tinkitchen till called for and the latter were less manageable things were in this state when the grand discovery was made and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before if she had not got the new idea into her head she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that beth was very quiet and laurie very kind to her but having given the rein to her lively fancy it galloped away with her at a great pace and common sense being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing did not come to the rescue as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by amusing her with all sorts of gossip for she depended on her weekly spin and he never disappointed her but that evening jo fancied that beths eyes rested on the lively dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricketmatch though the phrases caught off a tice stumped off his ground and the leg hit for three were as intelligible to her as sanscrit she also fancied having set her heart upon seeing it that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in lauries manner that he dropped his voice now and then laughed less than usual was a little absentminded and settled the afghan over beths feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender who knows stranger things have happened thought jo as she fussed about the room she will make quite an angel of him and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear if they only love each other i dont see how he can help it and i do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way as every one was out of the way but herself jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed but where should she go and burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion she sat down to settle that point now the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofalong broad wellcushioned and low a trifle shabby as well it might be for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies fished over the back rode on the arms and had menageries under it as children and rested tired heads dreamed dreams and listened to tender talk on it as young women they all loved it for it was a family refuge and one corner had always been jos favorite loungingplace among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one hard round covered with prickly horsehair and furnished with a knobby button at each end this repulsive pillow was her especial property being used as a weapon of defence a barricade or a stern preventive of too much slumber laurie knew this pillow well and had cause to regard it with deep aversion having been unmercifully pummelled with it in former days when romping was allowed and now frequently debarred by it from taking the seat he most coveted next to jo in the sofa corner if the sausage as they called it stood on end it was a sign that he might approach and repose but if it lay flat across the sofa woe to the man woman or child who dared disturb it that evening jo forgot to barricade her corner and had not been in her seat five minutes before a massive form appeared beside her and with both arms spread over the sofaback both long legs stretched out before him laurie exclaimed with a sigh of satisfaction now this is filling at the price illustration now this is filling at the price no slang snapped jo slamming down the pillow but it was too late there was no room for it and coasting on to the floor it disappeared in a most mysterious manner come jo dont be thorny after studying himself to a skeleton all the week a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it beth will pet you im busy no shes not to be bothered with me but you like that sort of thing unless youve suddenly lost your taste for it have you do you hate your boy and want to fire pillows at him anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard but jo quenched her boy by turning on him with the stern query how many bouquets have you sent miss randal this week not one upon my word shes engaged now then im glad of it thats one of your foolish extravagancessending flowers and things to girls for whom you dont care two pins continued jo reprovingly sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins wont let me send them flowers and things so what can i do my feelings must have a went mother doesnt approve of flirting even in fun and you do flirt desperately teddy id give anything if i could answer so do you as i cant ill merely say that i dont see any harm in that pleasant little game if all parties understand that its only play well it does look pleasant but i cant learn how its done ive tried because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing but i dont seem to get on said jo forgetting to play mentor take lessons of amy she has a regular talent for it yes she does it very prettily and never seems to go too far i suppose its natural to some people to please without trying and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place im glad you cant flirt its really refreshing to see a sensible straightforward girl who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself between ourselves jo some of the girls i know really do go on at such a rate im ashamed of them they dont mean any harm im sure but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward theyd mend their ways i fancy they do the same and as their tongues are the sharpest you fellows get the worst of it for you are as silly as they every bit if you behaved properly they would but knowing you like their nonsense they keep it up and then you blame them much you know about it maam said laurie in a superior tone we dont like romps and flirts though we may act as if we did sometimes the pretty modest girls are never talked about except respectfully among gentlemen bless your innocent soul if you could be in my place for a month youd see things that would astonish you a trifle upon my word when i see one of those harumscarum girls i always want to say with our friend cock robin out upon you fie upon you boldfaced jig it was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between lauries chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples jo knew that young laurence was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mammas was much smiled upon by their daughters and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him so she watched him rather jealously fearing he would be spoilt and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls returning suddenly to her admonitory tone she said dropping her voice if you must have a went teddy go and devote yourself to one of the pretty modest girls whom you do respect and not waste your time with the silly ones you really advise it and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face yes i do but youd better wait till you are through college on the whole and be fitting yourself for the place meantime youre not half good enough forwell whoever the modest girl maybe and jo looked a little queer likewise for a name had almost escaped her that im not acquiesced laurie with an expression of humility quite new to him as he dropped his eyes and absently wound jos aprontassel round his finger mercy on us this will never do thought jo adding aloud go and sing to me im dying for some music and always like yours id rather stay here thank you well you cant there isnt room go and make yourself useful since you are too big to be ornamental i thought you hated to be tied to a womans apronstring retorted jo quoting certain rebellious words of his own ah that depends on who wears the apron and laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel are you going demanded jo diving for the pillow he fled at once and the minute it was well up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman had departed in high dudgeon illustration up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee jo lay long awake that night and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to beths bedside with the anxious inquiry what is it dear i thought you were asleep sobbed beth is it the old pain my precious no its a new one but i can bear it and beth tried to check her tears tell me all about it and let me cure it as i often did the other you cant there is no cure there beths voice gave way and clinging to her sister she cried so despairingly that jo was frightened where is it shall i call mother beth did not answer the first question but in the dark one hand went involuntarily to her heart as if the pain were there with the other she held jo fast whispering eagerly no no dont call her dont tell her i shall be better soon lie down here and poor my head ill be quiet and go to sleep indeed i will jo obeyed but as her hand went softly to and fro across beths hot forehead and wet eyelids her heart was very full and she longed to speak but young as she was jo had learned that hearts like flowers cannot be rudely handled but must open naturally so though she believed she knew the cause of beths new pain she only said in her tenderest tone does anything trouble you deary yes jo after a long pause wouldnt it comfort you to tell me what it is not now not yet then i wont ask but remember bethy that mother and jo are always glad to hear and help you if they can i know it ill tell you by and by is the pain better now oh yes much better you are so comfortable jo go to sleep dear ill stay with you so cheek to cheek they fell asleep and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long and a loving word can medicine most ills but jo had made up her mind and after pondering over a project for some days she confided it to her mother you asked me the other day what my wishes were ill tell you one of them marmee she began as they sat alone together i want to go away somewhere this winter for a change why jo and her mother looked up quickly as if the words suggested a double meaning with her eyes on her work jo answered soberly i want something new i feel restless and anxious to be seeing doing and learning more than i am i brood too much over my own small affairs and need stirring up so as i can be spared this winter id like to hop a little way and try my wings where will you hop to new york i had a bright idea yesterday and this is it you know mrs kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew its rather hard to find just the thing but i think i should suit if i tried my dear go out to service in that great boardinghouse and mrs march looked surprised but not displeased its not exactly going out to service for mrs kirke is your friendthe kindest soul that ever livedand would make things pleasant for me i know her family is separate from the rest and no one knows me there dont care if they do its honest work and im not ashamed of it nor i but your writing all the better for the change i shall see and hear new things get new ideas and even if i havent much time there i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish i have no doubt of it but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy no mother may i know the others jo looked up and jo looked down then said slowly with sudden color in her cheeks it may be vain and wrong to say it butim afraidlaurie is getting too fond of me then you dont care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you and mrs march looked anxious as she put the question mercy no i love the dear boy as i always have and am immensely proud of him but as for anything more its out of the question im glad of that jo why please because dear i dont think you suited to one another as friends you are very happy and your frequent quarrels soon blow over but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life you are too much alike and too fond of freedom not to mention hot tempers and strong wills to get on happily together in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance as well as love thats just the feeling i had though i couldnt express it im glad you think he is only beginning to care for me it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy for i couldnt fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude could i you are sure of his feeling for you the color deepened in jos cheeks as she answered with the look of mingled pleasure pride and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers im afraid it is so mother he hasnt said anything but he looks a great deal i think i had better go away before it comes to anything i agree with you and if it can be managed you shall go jo looked relieved and after a pause said smiling how mrs moffat would wonder at your want of management if she knew and how she will rejoice that annie still may hope ah jo mothers may differ in their management but the hope is the same in allthe desire to see their children happy meg is so and i am content with her success you i leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it for only then will you find that there is something sweeter amy is my chief care now but her good sense will help her for beth i indulge no hopes except that she may be well by the way she seems brighter this last day or two have you spoken to her yes she owned she had a trouble and promised to tell me by and by i said no more for i think i know it and jo told her little story mrs march shook her head and did not take so romantic a view of the case but looked grave and repeated her opinion that for lauries sake jo should go away for a time let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled then ill run away before he can collect his wits and be tragical beth must think im going to please myself as i am for i cant talk about laurie to her but she can pet and comfort him after im gone and so cure him of this romantic notion hes been through so many little trials of the sort hes used to it and will soon get over his lovelornity jo spoke hopefully but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this little trial would be harder than the others and that laurie would not get over his lovelornity as easily as heretofore the plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon for mrs kirke gladly accepted jo and promised to make a pleasant home for her the teaching would render her independent and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone for the homenest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit when all was settled with fear and trembling she told laurie but to her surprise he took it very quietly he had been graver than usual of late but very pleasant and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf he answered soberly so i am and i mean this one shall stay turned jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then and made her preparations with a lightened heartfor beth seemed more cheerfuland hoped she was doing the best for all one thing i leave to your especial care she said the night before she left you mean your papers asked beth no my boy be very good to him wont you of course i will but i cant fill your place and hell miss you sadly it wont hurt him so remember i leave him in your charge to plague pet and keep in order ill do my best for your sake promised beth wondering why jo looked at her so queerly when laurie said goodby he whispered significantly it wont do a bit of good jo my eye is on you so mind what you do or ill come and bring you home illustration i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat xxxiii jos journal new york november dear marmee and beth im going to write you a regular volume for ive got heaps to tell though im not a fine young lady travelling on the continent when i lost sight of fathers dear old face i felt a trifle blue and might have shed a briny drop or two if an irish lady with four small children all crying more or less hadnt diverted my mind for i amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar soon the sun came out and taking it as a good omen i cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart mrs kirke welcomed me so kindly i felt at home at once even in that big house full of strangers she gave me a funny little skyparlorall she had but there is a stove in it and a nice table in a sunny window so i can sit here and write whenever i like a fine view and a churchtower opposite atone for the many stairs and i took a fancy to my den on the spot the nursery where i am to teach and sew is a pleasant room next mrs kirkes private parlor and the two little girls are pretty childrenrather spoilt i fancy but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs and ive no doubt i shall make a model governess i am to have my meals with the children if i prefer it to the great table and for the present i do for i am bashful though no one will believe it now my dear make yourself at home said mrs k in her motherly way im on the drive from morning to night as you may suppose with such a family but a great anxiety will be off my mind if i know the children are safe with you my rooms are always open to you and your own shall be as comfortable as i can make it there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable and your evenings are always free come to me if anything goes wrong and be as happy as you can theres the teabell i must run and change my cap and off she bustled leaving me to settle myself in my new nest as i went downstairs soon after i saw something i liked the flights are very long in this tall house and as i stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up i saw a gentleman come along behind her take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand carry it all the way up put it down at a door near by and walk away saying with a kind nod and a foreign accent it goes better so the little back is too young to haf such heaviness wasnt it good of him i like such things for as father says trifles show character when i mentioned it to mrs k that evening she laughed and said that must have been professor bhaer hes always doing things of that sort mrs k told me he was from berlin very learned and good but poor as a churchmouse and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here according to the wishes of his sister who married an american not a very romantic story but it interested me and i was glad to hear that mrs k lends him her parlor for some of his scholars there is a glass door between it and the nursery and i mean to peep at him and then ill tell you how he looks hes almost forty so its no harm marmee after tea and a gotobed romp with the little girls i attacked the big workbasket and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend i shall keep a journalletter and send it once a week so goodnight and more tomorrow tuesday eve had a lively time in my seminary this morning for the children acted like sancho and at one time i really thought i should shake them all round some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics and i kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still after luncheon the girl took them out for a walk and i went to my needlework like little mabel with a willing mind i was thanking my stars that id learned to make nice buttonholes when the parlordoor opened and shut and some one began to hum kennst du das land like a big bumblebee it was dreadfully improper i know but i couldnt resist the temptation and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door i peeped in professor bhaer was there and while he arranged his books i took a good look at him a regular germanrather stout with brown hair tumbled all over his head a bushy beard good nose the kindest eyes i ever saw and a splendid big voice that does ones ears good after our sharp or slipshod american gabble his clothes were rusty his hands were large and he hadnt a really handsome feature in his face except his beautiful teeth yet i liked him for he had a fine head his linen was very nice and he looked like a gentleman though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe he looked sober in spite of his humming till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun and stroke the cat who received him like an old friend then he smiled and when a tap came at the door called out in a loud brisk tone herein i was just going to run when i caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book and stopped to see what was going on me wants my bhaer said the mite slamming down her book and running to meet him thou shalt haf thy bhaer come then and take a goot hug from him my tina said the professor catching her up with a laugh and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him illustration thou shalt haf thy bhaer now me mus tuddy my lessin went on the funny little thing so he put her up at the table opened the great dictionary she had brought and gave her a paper and pencil and she scribbled away turning a leaf now and then and passing her little fat finger down the page as if finding a word so soberly that i nearly betrayed myself by a laugh while mr bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own though she looked more french than german another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work and there i virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door one of the girls kept laughing affectedly and saying now professor in a coquettish tone and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober both seemed to try his patience sorely for more than once i heard him say emphatically no no it is not so you haf not attend to what i say and once there was a loud rap as if he struck the table with his book followed by the despairing exclamation prut it all goes bad this day poor man i pitied him and when the girls were gone took just one more peep to see if he survived it he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair tired out and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two when he jumped up put his books in his pocket as if ready for another lesson and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms he carried her quietly away i fancy he has a hard life of it mrs kirke asked me if i wouldnt go down to the five oclock dinner and feeling a little bit homesick i thought i would just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me so i made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind mrs kirke but as she is short and im tall my efforts at concealment were rather a failure she gave me a seat by her and after my face cooled off i plucked up courage and looked about me the long table was full and every one intent on getting their dinnerthe gentlemen especially who seemed to be eating on time for they bolted in every sense of the word vanishing as soon as they were done there was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves young couples absorbed in each other married ladies in their babies and old gentlemen in politics i dont think i shall care to have much to do with any of them except one sweetfaced maiden lady who looks as if she had something in her cast away at the very bottom of the table was the professor shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive deaf old gentleman on one side and talking philosophy with a frenchman on the other if amy had been here shed have turned her back on him forever because sad to relate he had a great appetite and shovelled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified her ladyship i didnt mind for i like to see folks eat with a relish as hannah says and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day as i went upstairs after dinner two of the young men were settling their hats before the hallmirror and i heard one say low to the other whos the new party governess or something of that sort what the deuce is she at our table for friend of the old ladys handsome head but no style not a bit of it give us a light and come on i felt angry at first and then i didnt care for a governess is as good as a clerk and ive got sense if i havent style which is more than some people have judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away smoking like bad chimneys i hate ordinary people thursday yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching sewing and writing in my little room which is very cosey with a light and fire i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here the little thing has lost her heart to mr bhaer and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home which delights him as he is very fond of children though a bacheldore kitty and minnie kirke likewise regard him with affection and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents the presents he brings and the splendid tales he tells the young men quiz him it seems call him old fritz lager beer ursa major and make all manner of jokes on his name but he enjoys it like a boy mrs k says and takes it so goodnaturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways the maiden lady is a miss nortonrich cultivated and kind she spoke to me at dinner today for i went to table again its such fun to watch people and asked me to come and see her at her room she has fine books and pictures knows interesting persons and seems friendly so i shall make myself agreeable for i do want to get into good society only it isnt the same sort that amy likes i was in our parlor last evening when mr bhaer came in with some newspapers for mrs kirke she wasnt there but minnie who is a little old woman introduced me very prettily this is mammas friend miss march yes and shes jolly and we like her lots added kitty who is an enfant terrible we both bowed and then we laughed for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast ah yes i hear these naughty ones go to vex you mees marsch if so again call at me and i come he said with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches i promised i would and he departed but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him for today as i passed his door on my way out by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella it flew open and there he stood in his dressing gown with a big blue sock on one hand and a darningneedle in the other he didnt seem at all ashamed of it for when i explained and hurried on he waved his hand sock and all saying in his loud cheerful way illustration he waved his hand sock and all you haf a fine day to make your walk bon voyage mademoiselle i laughed all the way downstairs but it was a little pathetic also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes the german gentlemen embroider i know but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty saturday nothing has happened to write about except a call on miss norton who has a room full of lovely things and who was very charming for she showed me all her treasures and asked me if i would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts as her escortif i enjoyed them she put it as a favor but im sure mrs kirke has told her about us and she does it out of kindness to me im as proud as lucifer but such favors from such people dont burden me and i accepted gratefully when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in and there was mr bhaer down on his hands and knees with tina on his back kitty leading him with a jumprope and minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs we are playing nargerie explained kitty dis is mine effalunt added tina holding on by the professors hair illustration dis is mine effalunt mamma always allows us to do what we like saturday afternoon when franz and emil come doesnt she mr bhaer said minnie the effalunt sat up looking as much in earnest as any of them and said soberly to me i gif you my wort it is so if we make too large a noise you shall say hush to us and we go more softly i promised to do so but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they didfor a more glorious frolic i never witnessed they played tag and soldiers danced and sung and when it began to grow dark they all piled on to the sofa about the professor while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimneytops and the little kobolds who ride the snowflakes as they fall i wish americans were as simple and natural as germans dont you im so fond of writing i should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didnt stop me for though ive used thin paper and written fine i tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need pray forward amys as soon as you can spare them my small news will sound very flat after her splendors but you will like them i know is teddy studying so hard that he cant find time to write to his friends take good care of him for me beth and tell me all about the babies and give heaps of love to every one from your faithful jo p s on reading over my letter it strikes me as rather bhaery but i am always interested in odd people and i really had nothing else to write about bless you december my precious betsey as this is to be a scribblescrabble letter i direct it to you for it may amuse you and give you some idea of my goings on for though quiet they are rather amusing for which oh be joyful after what amy would call herculaneum efforts in the way of mental and moral agriculture my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish they are not so interesting to me as tina and the boys but i do my duty by them and they are fond of me franz and emil are jolly little lads quite after my own heart for the mixture of german and american spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence saturday afternoons are riotous times whether spent in the house or out for on pleasant days they all go to walk like a seminary with the professor and myself to keep order and then such fun we are very good friends now and ive begun to take lessons i really couldnt help it and it all came about in such a droll way that i must tell you to begin at the beginning mrs kirke called to me one day as i passed mr bhaers room where she was rummaging did you ever see such a den my dear just come and help me put these books to rights for ive turned everything upside down trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs i gave him not long ago i went in and while we worked i looked about me for it was a den to be sure books and papers everywhere a broken meerschaum and an old flute over the mantelpiece as if done with a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one windowseat and a box of white mice adorned the other halffinished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts dirty little boots stood drying before the fire and traces of the dearly beloved boys for whom he makes a slave of himself were to be seen all over the room after a grand rummage three of the missing articles were foundone over the birdcage one covered with ink and a third burnt brown having been used as a holder such a man laughed goodnatured mrs k as she put the relics in the ragbag i suppose the others are torn up to rig ships bandage cut fingers or make kitetails its dreadful but i cant scold him hes so absentminded and goodnatured he lets those boys ride over him roughshod i agreed to do his washing and mending but he forgets to give out his things and i forget to look them over so he comes to a sad pass sometimes let me mend them said i i dont mind it and he neednt know id like tohes so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books so i have got his things in order and knit heels into two pairs of the socksfor they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns nothing was said and i hoped he wouldnt find it out but one day last week he caught me at it hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to learn for tina runs in and out leaving the door open and i can hear i had been sitting near this door finishing off the last sock and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar who is as stupid as i am the girl had gone and i thought he had also it was so still and i was busily gabbling over a verb and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way when a little crow made me look up and there was mr bhaer looking and laughing quietly while he made signs to tina not to betray him so he said as i stopped and stared like a goose you peep at me i peep at you and that is not bad but see i am not pleasanting when i say haf you a wish for german yes but you are too busy i am too stupid to learn i blundered out as red as a peony prut we will make the time and we fail not to find the sense at efening i shall gif a little lesson with much gladness for look you mees marsch i haf this debt to pay and he pointed to my work yes they say to one another these so kind ladies he is a stupid old fellow he will see not what we do he will never opserve that his sockheels go not in holes any more he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall and believe that strings make theirselves ah but i haf an eye and i see much i haf a heart and i feel the thanks for this come a little lesson then and now or no more good fairy works for me and mine of course i couldnt say anything after that and as it really is a splendid opportunity i made the bargain and we began i took four lessons and then i stuck fast in a grammatical bog the professor was very patient with me but it must have been torment to him and now and then hed look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a tossup with me whether to laugh or cry i tried both ways and when it came to a sniff of utter mortification and woe he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room i felt myself disgraced and deserted forever but didnt blame him a particle and was scrambling my papers together meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard when in he came as brisk and beaming as if id covered myself with glory now we shall try a new way you and i will read these pleasant little mrchen together and dig no more in that dry book that goes in the corner for making us trouble he spoke so kindly and opened hans andersens fairy tales so invitingly before me that i was more ashamed than ever and went at my lesson in a neckornothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely i forgot my bashfulness and pegged away no other word will express it with all my might tumbling over long words pronouncing according to the inspiration of the minute and doing my very best when i finished reading my first page and stopped for breath he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way das ist gute now we go well my turn i do him in german gif me your ear and away he went rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear fortunately the story was the constant tin soldier which is droll you know so i could laughand i didthough i didnt understand half he read for i couldnt help it he was so earnest i so excited and the whole thing so comical after that we got on better and now i read my lessons pretty well for this way of studying suits me and i can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly i like it very much and he doesnt seem tired of it yetwhich is very good of him isnt it i mean to give him something on christmas for i dare not offer money tell me something nice marmee im glad laurie seems so happy and busy that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow you see beth manages him better than i did im not jealous dear do your best only dont make a saint of him im afraid i couldnt like him without a spice of human naughtiness read him bits of my letters i havent time to write much and that will do just as well thank heaven beth continues so comfortable january a happy new year to you all my dearest family which of course includes mr l and a young man by the name of teddy i cant tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle for i didnt get it till night and had given up hoping your letter came in the morning but you said nothing about a parcel meaning it for a surprise so i was disappointed for id had a kind of a feeling that you wouldnt forget me i felt a little low in my mind as i sat up in my room after tea and when the big muddy batteredlooking bundle was brought to me i just hugged it and pranced it was so homey and refreshing that i sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried in my usual absurd way the things were just what i wanted and all the better for being made instead of bought beths new inkbib was capital and hannahs box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure ill be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent marmee and read carefully the books father has marked thank you all heaps and heaps illustration i sat down upon the floor and read and looked and ate speaking of books reminds me that im getting rich in that line for on new years day mr bhaer gave me a fine shakespeare it is one he values much and ive often admired it set up in the place of honor with his german bible plato homer and milton so you may imagine how i felt when he brought it down without its cover and showed me my name in it from my friend friedrich bhaer you say often you wish a library here i gif you one for between these lids he meant covers is many books in one read him well and he will help you much for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen i thanked him as well as i could and talk now about my library as if i had a hundred books i never knew how much there was in shakespeare before but then i never had a bhaer to explain it to me now dont laugh at his horrid name it isnt pronounced either bear or beer as people will say it but something between the two as only germans can give it im glad you both like what i tell you about him and hope you will know him some day mother would admire his warm heart father his wise head i admire both and feel rich in my new friend friedrich bhaer not having much money or knowing what hed like i got several little things and put them about the room where he would find them unexpectedly they were useful pretty or funnya new standish on his table a little vase for his flowerhe always has one or a bit of green in a glass to keep him fresh he saysand a holder for his blower so that he neednt burn up what amy calls mouchoirs i made it like those beth inventeda big butterfly with a fat body and black and yellow wings worsted feelers and bead eyes it took his fancy immensely and he put it on his mantelpiece as an article of vertu so it was rather a failure after all poor as he is he didnt forget a servant or a child in the house and not a soul here from the french laundrywoman to miss norton forgot him i was so glad of that they got up a masquerade and had a gay time new years eve i didnt mean to go down having no dress but at the last minute mrs kirke remembered some old brocades and miss norton lent me lace and feathers so i dressed up as mrs malaprop and sailed in with a mask on no one knew me for i disguised my voice and no one dreamed of the silent haughty miss march for they think i am very stiff and cool most of them and so i am to whippersnappers could dance and dress and burst out into a nice derangement of epitaphs like an allegory on the banks of the nile i enjoyed it very much and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me i heard one of the young men tell another that he knew id been an actress in fact he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theatres meg will relish that joke mr bhaer was nick bottom and tina was titaniaa perfect little fairy in his arms to see them dance was quite a landscape to use a teddyism i had a very happy new year after all and when i thought it over in my room i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures for im cheerful all the time now work with a will and take more interest in other people than i used to which is satisfactory bless you all ever your loving jo illustration tailpiece illustration in the presence of three gentlemen xxxiv a friend though very happy in the social atmosphere about her and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort jo still found time for literary labors the purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl but the means she took to gain her end were not the best she saw that money conferred power money and power therefore she resolved to have not to be used for herself alone but for those whom she loved more than self the dream of filling home with comforts giving beth everything she wanted from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom going abroad herself and always having more than enough so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity had been for years jos most cherished castle in the air the prizestory experience had seemed to open a way which might after long travelling and much uphill work lead to this delightful chteau en espagne but the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouterhearted jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers like that immortal hero she reposed awhile after the first attempt which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giants treasures if i remember rightly but the up again and take another spirit was as strong in jo as in jack so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags she took to writing sensation stories for in those dark ages even allperfect america read rubbish she told no one but concocted a thrilling tale and boldly carried it herself to mr dashwood editor of the weekly volcano she had never read sartor resartus but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners so she dressed herself in her best and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room a cloud of cigarsmoke and the presence of three gentlemen sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance somewhat daunted by this reception jo hesitated on the threshold murmuring in much embarrassment excuse me i was looking for the weekly volcano office i wished to see mr dashwood down went the highest pair of heels up rose the smokiest gentleman and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep feeling that she must get through the matter somehow jo produced her manuscript and blushing redder and redder with each sentence blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion a friend of mine desired me to offera storyjust as an experimentwould like your opinionbe glad to write more if this suits while she blushed and blundered mr dashwood had taken the manuscript and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages not a first attempt i take it observing that the pages were numbered covered only on one side and not tied up with a ribbonsure sign of a novice no sir she has had some experience and got a prize for a tale in the blarneystone banner oh did she and mr dashwood gave jo a quick look which seemed to take note of everything she had on from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots well you can leave it if you like weve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present but ill run my eye over it and give you an answer next week now jo did not like to leave it for mr dashwood didnt suit her at all but under the circumstances there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away looking particularly tall and dignified as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed just then she was both for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of my friend was considered a good joke and a laugh produced by some inaudible remark of the editor as he closed the door completed her discomfiture half resolving never to return she went home and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week when she went again mr dashwood was alone whereat she rejoiced mr dashwood was much wider awake than before which was agreeable and mr dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first well take this editors never say i if you dont object to a few alterations its too long but omitting the passages ive marked will make it just the right length he said in a businesslike tone jo hardly knew her own ms again so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her babys legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflectionswhich she had carefully put in as ballast for much romancehad been stricken out but sir i thought every story should have some sort of a moral so i took care to have a few of my sinners repent mr dashwoods editorial gravity relaxed into a smile for jo had forgotten her friend and spoken as only an author could people want to be amused not preached at you know morals dont sell nowadays which was not quite a correct statement by the way you think it would do with these alterations then yes its a new plot and pretty well worked uplanguage good and so on was mr dashwoods affable reply what do youthat is what compensation began jo not exactly knowing how to express herself oh yes well we give from twentyfive to thirty for things of this sort pay when it comes out returned mr dashwood as if that point had escaped him such trifles often do escape the editorial mind it is said very well you can have it said jo handing back the story with a satisfied air for after the dollaracolumn work even twentyfive seemed good pay shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this asked jo unconscious of her little slip of the tongue and emboldened by her success well well look at it cant promise to take it tell her to make it short and spicy and never mind the moral what name would your friend like to put to it in a careless tone none at all if you please she doesnt wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume said jo blushing in spite of herself just as she likes of course the tale will be out next week will you call for the money or shall i send it asked mr dashwood who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be ill call good morning sir as she departed mr dashwood put up his feet with the graceful remark poor and proud as usual but shell do following mr dashwoods directions and making mrs northbury her model jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature but thanks to the lifepreserver thrown her by a friend she came up again not much the worse for her ducking like most young scribblers she went abroad for her characters and scenery and banditti counts gypsies nuns and duchesses appeared upon her stage and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar punctuation and probability and mr dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks on being offered higher wages had basely left him in the lurch she soon became interested in her work for her emaciated purse grew stout and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed one thing disturbed her satisfaction and that was that she did not tell them at home she had a feeling that father and mother would not approve and preferred to have her own way first and beg pardon afterward it was easy to keep her secret for no name appeared with her stories mr dashwood had of course found it out very soon but promised to be dumb and for a wonder kept his word she thought it would do her no harm for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she should be ashamed and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her wellkept secret but mr dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers history and romance land and sea science and art police records and lunatic asylums had to be ransacked for the purpose jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society so regarding it in a business light she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy eager to find material for stories and bent on making them original in plot if not masterly in execution she searched newspapers for accidents incidents and crimes she excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons she studied faces in the street and characters good bad and indifferent all about her she delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new and introduced herself to folly sin and misery as well as her limited opportunities allowed she thought she was prospering finely but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a womans character she was living in bad society and imaginary though it was its influence affected her for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life which comes soon enough to all of us she was beginning to feel rather than see this for much describing of other peoples passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her owna morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge wrongdoing always brings its own punishment and when jo most needed hers she got it i dont know whether the study of shakespeare helped her to read character or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest brave and strong but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun jo was discovering a live hero who interested her in spite of many human imperfections mr bhaer in one of their conversations had advised her to study simple true and lovely characters wherever she found them as good training for a writer jo took him at his word for she coolly turned round and studied hima proceeding which would have much surprised him had he known it for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit why everybody liked him was what puzzled jo at first he was neither rich nor great young nor handsome in no respect what is called fascinating imposing or brilliant and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth he was poor yet always appeared to be giving something away a stranger yet every one was his friend no longer young but as happyhearted as a boy plain and peculiar yet his face looked beautiful to many and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake jo often watched him trying to discover the charm and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle if he had any sorrow it sat with its head under its wing and he turned only his sunny side to the world there were lines upon his forehead but time seemed to have touched him gently remembering how kind he was to others the pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs his eyes were never cold or hard and his big hand had a warm strong grasp that was more expressive than words his very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer they looked as if they were at ease and liked to make him comfortable his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath his rusty coat had a social air and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full his very boots were benevolent and his collars never stiff and raspy like other peoples thats it said jo to herself when she at length discovered that genuine goodwill towards ones fellowmen could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher who shovelled in his dinner darned his own socks and was burdened with the name of bhaer jo valued goodness highly but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect and a little discovery which she made about the professor added much to her regard for him he never spoke of himself and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity till a countryman came to see him and in a conversation with miss norton divulged the pleasing fact from her jo learned it and liked it all the better because mr bhaer had never told it she felt proud to know that he was an honored professor in berlin though only a poor languagemaster in america and his homely hardworking life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner miss norton had the entre into literary society which jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her the solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on jo and the professor she took them with her one night to a select symposium held in honor of several celebrities illustration a select symposium jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshipped with youthful enthusiasm afar off but her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all imagine her dismay on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on spirit fire and dew to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance turning as from a fallen idol she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de stals of the age who looked daggers at another corinne who was amiably satirizing her after outmanuvring her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible the scientific celebrities forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods gossiped about art while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy the young musician who was charming the city like a second orpheus talked horses and the specimen of the british nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party before the evening was half over jo felt so completely dsillusione that she sat down in a corner to recover herself mr bhaer soon joined her looking rather out of his element and presently several of the philosophers each mounted on his hobby came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess the conversation was miles beyond jos comprehension but she enjoyed it though kant and hegel were unknown gods the subjective and objective unintelligible terms and the only thing evolved from her inner consciousness was a bad headache after it was all over it dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces and put together on new and according to the talkers on infinitely better principles than before that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness and intellect was to be the only god jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort but a curious excitement half pleasurable half painful came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space like a young balloon out on a holiday she looked round to see how the professor liked it and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear he shook his head and beckoned her to come away but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy and kept her seat trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs now mr bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions not because they were unsettled but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken as he glanced from jo to several other young people attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics he knit his brows and longed to speak fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand he bore it as long as he could but when he was appealed to for an opinion he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truthan eloquence which made his broken english musical and his plain face beautiful he had a hard fight for the wise men argued well but he didnt know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man somehow as he talked the world got right again to jo the old beliefs that had lasted so long seemed better than the new god was not a blind force and immortality was not a pretty fable but a blessed fact she felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again and when mr bhaer paused outtalked but not one whit convinced jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him she did neither but she remembered this scene and gave the professor her heartiest respect for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there because his conscience would not let him be silent she began to see that character is a better possession than money rank intellect or beauty and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be truth reverence and goodwill then her friend friedrich bhaer was not only good but great this belief strengthened daily she valued his esteem she coveted his respect she wanted to be worthy of his friendship and just when the wish was sincerest she came near losing everything it all grew out of a cocked hat for one evening the professor came in to give jo her lesson with a paper soldiercap on his head which tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off its evident he doesnt look in his glass before coming down thought jo with a smile as he said goot efening and sat soberly down quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear for he was going to read her the death of wallenstein illustration he doesnt prink at his glass before coming she said nothing at first for she liked to hear him laugh out his big hearty laugh when anything funny happened so she left him to discover it for himself and presently forgot all about it for to hear a german read schiller is rather an absorbing occupation after the reading came the lesson which was a lively one for jo was in a gay mood that night and the cockedhat kept her eyes dancing with merriment the professor didnt know what to make of her and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible mees marsch for what do you laugh in your masters face haf you no respect for me that you go on so bad how can i be respectful sir when you forget to take your hat off said jo lifting his hand to his head the absentminded professor gravely felt and removed the little cockedhat looked at it a minute and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bassviol ah i see him now it is that imp tina who makes me a fool with my cap well it is nothing but see you if this lesson goes not well you too shall wear him but the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because mr bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat and unfolding it said with an air of great disgust i wish these papers did not come in the house they are not for children to see nor young people to read it is not well and i haf no patience with those who make this harm jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic a corpse a villain and a viper she did not like it but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear because for a minute she fancied the paper was the volcano it was not however and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it there would have been no name to betray her she had betrayed herself however by a look and a blush for though an absent man the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied he knew that jo wrote and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once but as she never spoke of it he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own and it troubled him he did not say to himself it is none of my business ive no right to say anything as many people would have done he only remembered that she was young and poor a girl far away from mothers love and fathers care and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle all this flashed through his mind in a minute but not a trace of it appeared in his face and by the time the paper was turned and jos needle threaded he was ready to say quite naturally but very gravely yes you are right to put it from you i do not like to think that good young girls should see such things they are made pleasant to some but i would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash all may not be bad only silly you know and if there is a demand for it i dont see any harm in supplying it many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories said jo scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin there is a demand for whiskey but i think you and i do not care to sell it if the respectable people knew what harm they did they would not feel that the living was honest they haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum and let the small ones eat it no they should think a little and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing mr bhaer spoke warmly and walked to the fire crumpling the paper in his hands jo sat still looking as if the fire had come to her for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney i should like much to send all the rest after him muttered the professor coming back with a relieved air jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make and her hardearned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute then she thought consolingly to herself mine are not like that they are only silly never bad so i wont be worried and taking up her book she said with a studious face shall we go on sir ill be very good and proper now i shall hope so was all he said but he meant more than she imagined and the grave kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words weekly volcano were printed in large type on her forehead as soon as she went to her room she got out her papers and carefully reread every one of her stories being a little shortsighted mr bhaer sometimes used eyeglasses and jo had tried them once smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book now she seemed to have got on the professors mental or moral spectacles also for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay they are trash and will soon be worse than trash if i go on for each is more sensational than the last ive gone blindly on hurting myself and other people for the sake of money i know its so for i cant read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr bhaer got hold of them jo turned hot at the bare idea and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze illustration jo stuffed the whole bundle into the stove yes thats the best place for such inflammable nonsense id better burn the house down i suppose than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder she thought as she watched the demon of the jura whisk away a little black cinder with fiery eyes but when nothing remained of all her three months work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap jo looked sober as she sat on the floor wondering what she ought to do about her wages i think i havent done much harm yet and may keep this to pay for my time she said after a long meditation adding impatiently i almost wish i hadnt any conscience its so inconvenient if i didnt care about doing right and didnt feel uncomfortable when doing wrong i should get on capitally i cant help wishing sometimes that father and mother hadnt been so particular about such things ah jo instead of wishing that thank god that father and mother were particular and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prisonwalls to impatient youth but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood jo wrote no more sensational stories deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation but going to the other extreme as is the way with people of her stamp she took a course of mrs sherwood miss edgeworth and hannah more and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon so intensely moral was it she had her doubts about it from the beginning for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century she sent this didactic gem to several markets but it found no purchaser and she was inclined to agree with mr dashwood that morals didnt sell then she tried a childs story which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it the only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief but much as she liked to write for children jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular sabbathschool nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues so nothing came of these trials and jo corked up her inkstand and said in a fit of very wholesome humility i dont know anything ill wait till i do before i try again and meantime sweep mud in the street if i cant do better thats honest at least which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good while these internal revolutions were going on her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but professor bhaer he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof but she stood the test and he was satisfied for though no words passed between them he knew that she had given up writing not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky but she spent her evenings downstairs now was met no more among newspaper offices and studied with a dogged patience which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful if not pleasant he helped her in many ways proving himself a true friend and jo was happy for while her pen lay idle she was learning other lessons beside german and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life it was a pleasant winter and a long one for she did not leave mrs kirke till june every one seemed sorry when the time came the children were inconsolable and mr bhaers hair stuck straight up all over his head for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind going home ah you are happy that you haf a home to go in he said when she told him and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner while she held a little levee on that last evening she was going early so she bade them all goodby over night and when his turn came she said warmly now sir you wont forget to come and see us if you ever travel our way will you ill never forgive you if you do for i want them all to know my friend do you shall i come he asked looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see yes come next month laurie graduates then and youd enjoy commencement as something new that is your best friend of whom you speak he said in an altered tone yes my boy teddy im very proud of him and should like you to see him jo looked up then quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another something in mr bhaers face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find laurie more than a best friend and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter she involuntarily began to blush and the more she tried not to the redder she grew if it had not been for tina on her knee she didnt know what would have become of her fortunately the child was moved to hug her so she managed to hide her face an instant hoping the professor did not see it but he did and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression as he said cordially i fear i shall not make the time for that but i wish the friend much success and you all happiness gott bless you and with that he shook hands warmly shouldered tina and went away but after the boys were abed he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the heimweh or homesickness lying heavy at his heart once when he remembered jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face he leaned his head on his hands a minute and then roamed about the room as if in search of something that he could not find it is not for me i must not hope it now he said to himself with a sigh that was almost a groan then as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress he went and kissed the two towzled heads upon the pillow took down his seldomused meerschaum and opened his plato he did his best and did it manfully but i dont think he found that a pair of rampant boys a pipe or even the divine plato were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child and home early as it was he was at the station next morning to see jo off and thanks to him she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell a bunch of violets to keep her company and best of all the happy thought well the winters gone and ive written no books earned no fortune but ive made a friend worth having and ill try to keep him all my life illustration he put the sisters into the carriage xxxv heartache whatever his motive might have been laurie studied to some purpose that year for he graduated with honor and gave the latin oration with the grace of a phillips and the eloquence of a demosthenes so his friends said they were all there his grandfatheroh so proudmr and mrs march john and meg jo and beth and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time but fail to win from the world by any aftertriumphs ive got to stay for this confounded supper but i shall be home early tomorrow youll come and meet me as usual girls laurie said as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over he said girls but he meant jo for she was the only one who kept up the old custom she had not the heart to refuse her splendid successful boy anything and answered warmly ill come teddy rain or shine and march before you playing hail the conquering hero comes on a jewsharp laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic oh deary me i know hell say something and then what shall i do evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears and having decided that she wouldnt be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be she set forth at the appointed time hoping teddy wouldnt do anything to make her hurt his poor little feelings a call at megs and a refreshing sniff and sip at the daisy and demijohn still further fortified her for the ttette but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance she had a strong desire to turn about and run away wheres the jewsharp jo cried laurie as soon as he was within speaking distance i forgot it and jo took heart again for that salutation could not be called loverlike she always used to take his arm on these occasions now she did not and he made no complaint which was a bad sign but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove then he walked more slowly suddenly lost his fine flow of language and now and then a dreadful pause occurred to rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling jo said hastily now you must have a good long holiday i intend to something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come and made her put out her hand with an imploring no teddy please dont i will and you must hear me its no use jo weve got to have it out and the sooner the better for both of us he answered getting flushed and excited all at once say what you like then ill listen said jo with a desperate sort of patience laurie was a young lover but he was in earnest and meant to have it out if he died in the attempt so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuosity saying in a voice that would get choky now and then in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady ive loved you ever since ive known you jo couldnt help it youve been so good to me ive tried to show it but you wouldnt let me now im going to make you hear and give me an answer for i cant go on so any longer i wanted to save you this i thought youd understand began jo finding it a great deal harder than she expected i know you did but girls are so queer you never know what they mean they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it returned laurie entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact i dont i never wanted to make you care for me so and i went away to keep you from it if i could i thought so it was like you but it was no use i only loved you all the more and i worked hard to please you and i gave up billiards and everything you didnt like and waited and never complained for i hoped youd love me though im not half good enough here there was a choke that couldnt be controlled so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his confounded throat yes you are youre a great deal too good for me and im so grateful to you and so proud and fond of you i dont see why i cant love you as you want me to ive tried but i cant change the feeling and it would be a lie to say i do when i dont really truly jo he stopped short and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget really truly dear they were in the grove now close by the stile and when the last words fell reluctantly from jos lips laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on but for once in his life that fence was too much for him so he just laid his head down on the mossy post and stood so still that jo was frightened illustration he laid his head down on the mossy post o teddy im so sorry so desperately sorry i could kill myself if it would do any good i wish you wouldnt take it so hard i cant help it you know its impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they dont cried jo inelegantly but remorsefully as she softly patted his shoulder remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago they do sometimes said a muffled voice from the post i dont believe its the right sort of love and id rather not try it was the decided answer there was a long pause while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river and the tall grass rustled in the wind presently jo said very soberly as she sat down on the step of the stile laurie i want to tell you something he started as if he had been shot threw up his head and cried out in a fierce tone dont tell me that jo i cant bear it now tell what she asked wondering at his violence that you love that old man what old man demanded jo thinking he must mean his grandfather that devilish professor you were always writing about if you say you love him i know i shall do something desperate and he looked as if he would keep his word as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes jo wanted to laugh but restrained herself and said warmly for she too was getting excited with all this dont swear teddy he isnt old nor anything bad but good and kind and the best friend ive got next to you pray dont fly into a passion i want to be kind but i know i shall get angry if you abuse my professor i havent the least idea of loving him or anybody else but you will after a while and then what will become of me youll love some one else too like a sensible boy and forget all this trouble i cant love any one else and ill never forget you jo never never with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words what shall i do with him sighed jo finding that emotions were more unmanageable than she expected you havent heard what i wanted to tell you sit down and listen for indeed i want to do right and make you happy she said hoping to soothe him with a little reason which proved that she knew nothing about love seeing a ray of hope in that last speech laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile and looked up at her with an expectant face now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on jos part for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him she gently turned his head away saying as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sakehow touching that was to be sure i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable if we were so foolish as to jo paused a little over the last word but laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression marryno we shouldnt if you loved me jo i should be a perfect saint for you could make me anything you like no i cant ive tried it and failed and i wont risk our happiness by such a serious experiment we dont agree and we never shall so well be good friends all our lives but we wont go and do anything rash yes we will if we get the chance muttered laurie rebelliously now do be reasonable and take a sensible view of the case implored jo almost at her wits end i wont be reasonable i dont want to take what you call a sensible view it wont help me and it only makes you harder i dont believe youve got any heart i wish i hadnt there was a little quiver in jos voice and thinking it a good omen laurie turned round bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before dont disappoint us dear every one expects it grandpa has set his heart upon it your people like it and i cant get on without you say you will and lets be happy do do not until months afterward did jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy and never could it was very hard to do but she did it knowing that delay was both useless and cruel i cant say yes truly so i wont say it at all youll see that im right by and by and thank me for itshe began solemnly ill be hanged if i do and laurie bounced up off the grass burning with indignation at the bare idea yes you will persisted jo youll get over this after a while and find some lovely accomplished girl who will adore you and make a fine mistress for your fine house i shouldnt im homely and awkward and odd and old and youd be ashamed of me and we should quarrelwe cant help it even now you seeand i shouldnt like elegant society and you would and youd hate my scribbling and i couldnt get on without it and we should be unhappy and wish we hadnt done it and everything would be horrid anything more asked laurie finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst nothing more except that i dont believe i shall ever marry im happy as i am and love my liberty too well to be in any hurry to give it up for any mortal man i know better broke in laurie you think so now but therell come a time when you will care for somebody and youll love him tremendously and live and die for him i know you will its your way and i shall have to stand by and see it and the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical if his face had not been so tragical yes i will live and die for him if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself and you must do the best you can cried jo losing patience with poor teddy ive done my best but you wont be reasonable and its selfish of you to keep teasing for what i cant give i shall always be fond of you very fond indeed as a friend but ill never marry you and the sooner you believe it the better for both of usso now that speech was like fire to gunpowder laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself then turned sharply away saying in a desperate sort of tone youll be sorry some day jo oh where are you going she cried for his face frightened her to the devil was the consoling answer for a minute jos heart stood still as he swung himself down the bank toward the river but it takes much folly sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death and laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat and row away with all his might making better time up the river than he had done in many a race jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart that will do him good and hell come home in such a tender penitent state of mind that i shant dare to see him she said adding as she went slowly home feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing and buried it under the leaves now i must go and prepare mr laurence to be very kind to my poor boy i wish hed love beth perhaps he may in time but i begin to think i was mistaken about her oh dear how can girls like to have lovers and refuse them i think its dreadful being sure that no one could do it so well as herself she went straight to mr laurence told the hard story bravely through and then broke down crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman though sorely disappointed did not utter a reproach he found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving laurie and hoped she would change her mind but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harms way for young impetuositys parting words to jo disturbed him more than he would confess when laurie came home dead tired but quite composed his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two but when they sat together in the twilight the time they used to enjoy so much it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last years success which to him now seemed loves labor lost he bore it as long as he could then went to his piano and began to play the windows were open and jo walking in the garden with beth for once understood music better than her sister for he played the sonata pathtique and played it as he never did before thats very fine i dare say but its sad enough to make one cry give us something gayer lad said mr laurence whose kind old heart was full of sympathy which he longed to show but knew not how laurie dashed into a livelier strain played stormily for several minutes and would have got through bravely if in a momentary lull mrs marchs voice had not been heard calling jo dear come in i want you just what laurie longed to say with a different meaning as he listened he lost his place the music ended with a broken chord and the musician sat silent in the dark i cant stand this muttered the old gentleman up he got groped his way to the piano laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders and said as gently as a woman i know my boy i know no answer for an instant then laurie asked sharply who told you jo herself then theres an end of it and he shook off his grandfathers hands with an impatient motion for though grateful for the sympathy his mans pride could not bear a mans pity not quite i want to say one thing and then there shall be an end of it returned mr laurence with unusual mildness you wont care to stay at home just now perhaps i dont intend to run away from a girl jo cant prevent my seeing her and i shall stay and do it as long as i like interrupted laurie in a defiant tone not if you are the gentleman i think you im disappointed but the girl cant help it and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time where will you go anywhere i dont care what becomes of me and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfathers ear take it like a man and dont do anything rash for gods sake why not go abroad as you planned and forget it i cant but youve been wild to go and i promised you should when you got through college ah but i didnt mean to go alone and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see i dont ask you to go alone theres some one ready and glad to go with you anywhere in the world who sir stopping to listen myself laurie came back as quickly as he went and put out his hand saying huskily im a selfish brute butyou knowgrandfather lord help me yes i do know for ive been through it all before once in my own young days and then with your father now my dear boy just sit quietly down and hear my plan its all settled and can be carried out at once said mr laurence keeping hold of the young man as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him well sir what is it and laurie sat down without a sign of interest in face or voice there is business in london that needs looking after i meant you should attend to it but i can do it better myself and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them my partners do almost everything im merely holding on till you take my place and can be off at any time but you hate travelling sir i cant ask it of you at your age began laurie who was grateful for the sacrifice but much preferred to go alone if he went at all the old gentleman knew that perfectly well and particularly desired to prevent it for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices so stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him he said stoutly bless your soul im not superannuated yet i quite enjoy the idea it will do me good and my old bones wont suffer for travelling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy or that he did not like the plan and made the old man add hastily i dont mean to be a marplot or a burden i go because i think youd feel happier than if i was left behind i dont intend to gad about with you but leave you free to go where you like while i amuse myself in my own way ive friends in london and paris and should like to visit them meantime you can go to italy germany switzerland where you will and enjoy pictures music scenery and adventures to your hearts content now laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence the broken heart gave an unexpected leap and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness he sighed and then said in a spiritless tone just as you like sir it doesnt matter where i go or what i do it does to me remember that my lad i give you entire liberty but i trust you to make an honest use of it promise me that laurie anything you like sir good thought the old gentleman you dont care now but therell come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief or im much mistaken being an energetic individual mr laurence struck while the iron was hot and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel they were off during the time necessary for preparation laurie bore himself as young gentlemen usually do in such cases he was moody irritable and pensive by turns lost his appetite neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano avoided jo but consoled himself by staring at her from his window with a tragical face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day unlike some sufferers he never spoke of his unrequited passion and would allow no one not even mrs march to attempt consolation or offer sympathy on some accounts this was a relief to his friends but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable and every one rejoiced that the poor dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble and come home happy of course he smiled darkly at their delusion but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable when the parting came he affected high spirits to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves this gayety did not impose upon anybody but they tried to look as if it did for his sake and he got on very well till mrs march kissed him with a whisper full of motherly solicitude then feeling that he was going very fast he hastily embraced them all round not forgetting the afflicted hannah and ran downstairs as if for his life jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round he did look round came back put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal both eloquent and pathetic o jo cant you illustration o jo cant you teddy dear i wish i could that was all except a little pause then laurie straightened himself up said its all right never mind and went away without another word ah but it wasnt all right and jo did mind for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend and when he left her without a look behind him she knew that the boy laurie never would come again illustration tailpiece xxxvi beths secret when jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in beth no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on jos heart as she saw her sisters face it was no paler and but little thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo for a time forgot her fear but when laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her she had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed the mountain trip beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies jo took beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh seabreezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks it was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for any one else so they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they excited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away they did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and beths but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadow grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in jos lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet illustration with her head in jos lap while the wind blew healthfully over her one day beth told her jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on beths cheeks but she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been gathering it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away from her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say jo dear im glad you know it ive tried to tell you but i couldnt there was no answer except her sisters cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry she was the weaker then and beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear ive known it for a good while dear and now im used to it it isnt hard to think of or to bear try to see it so and dont be troubled about me because its best indeed it is is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn beth you did not feel it then and keep it to yourself so long did you asked jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that laurie had no part in beths trouble yes i gave up hoping then but i didnt like to own it i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble any one but when i saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that i could never be like you and then i was miserable jo o beth and you didnt tell me didnt let me comfort and help you how could you shut me out and bear it all alone jos voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodby to health love and life and take up her cross so cheerfully perhaps it was wrong but i tried to do right i wasnt sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken it would have been selfish to frighten you all when marmee was so anxious about meg and amy away and you so happy with laurieat least i thought so then and i thought that you loved him beth and i went away because i couldnt cried jo glad to say all the truth beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you didnt deary i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child i do love him dearly he is so good to me how can i help it but he never could be anything to me but my brother i hope he truly will be sometime not through me said jo decidedly amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now i dont care what becomes of anybody but you beth you must get well i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back its like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it cant be stopped it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth i cant let you go ill work and pray and fight against it ill keep you in spite of everything there must be ways it cant be too late god wont be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than beths simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself she could not say im glad to go for life was very sweet to her she could only sob out i try to be willing while she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together by and by beth said with recovered serenity youll tell them this when we go home i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day perhaps not ive heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things if they dont see it you will tell them for me i dont want any secrets and its kinder to prepare them meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother wont you jo if i can but beth i dont give up yet im going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think its true said jo trying to speak cheerfully beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i dont know how to express myself and shouldnt try to any one but you because i cant speak out except to my jo i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long im not like the rest of you i never made any plans about what id do when i grew up i never thought of being married as you all did i couldnt seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all im not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide a whitewinged gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness a little graycoated sandbird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea it came quite close to beth looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed dear little bird see jo how tame it is i like peeps better than the gulls they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of mebusy quakercolored creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she writes about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again dear little girl shes so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her im going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth jo dear dont hope any more it wont do any good im sure of that we wont be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait well have happy times for i dont suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth she was right there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be at home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling beths secret her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word illustration tailpiece illustration he hurried forward to meet her xxxvii new impressions at three oclock in the afternoon all the fashionable world at nice may be seen on the promenade des anglaisa charming place for the wide walk bordered with palms flowers and tropical shrubs is bounded on one side by the sea on the other by the grand drive lined with hotels and villas while beyond lie orangeorchards and the hills many nations are represented many languages spoken many costumes worn and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival haughty english lively french sober germans handsome spaniards ugly russians meek jews freeandeasy americans all drive sit or saunter here chatting over the news and criticising the latest celebrity who has arrivedristori or dickens victor emmanuel or the queen of the sandwich islands the equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basketbarouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance he looked like an italian was dressed like an englishman and had the independent air of an americana combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with rosecolored neckties buff gloves and orangeflowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches there were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl or lady in blue presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the jardin publique or to wander along the beach toward castle hill the quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single lady came rapidly down the street the lady was young blonde and dressed in blue he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her o laurie is it really you i thought youd never come cried amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a french mamma who hastened her daughters steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad english i was detained by the way but i promised to spend christmas with you and here i am how is your grandfather when did you come where are you staying very welllast nightat the chauvain i called at your hotel but you were all out i have so much to say i dont know where to begin get in and we can talk at our ease i was going for a drive and longing for company flos saving up for tonight what happens then a ball a christmas party at our hotel there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day youll go with us of course aunt will be charmed thank you where now asked laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited amy who preferred to drive for her parasolwhip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction im going to the bankers first for letters and then to castle hill the view is so lovely and i like to feed the peacocks have you ever been there often years ago but i dont mind having a look at it now tell me all about yourself the last i heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from berlin yes i spent a month there and then joined him in paris where he has settled for the winter he has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so i go and come and we get on capitally thats a sociable arrangement said amy missing something in lauries manner though she couldnt tell what why you see he hates to travel and i hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble i am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while i like to feel that some one is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings dirty old hole isnt it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the place napoleon in the old city the dirt is picturesque so i dont mind the river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow crossstreets are my delight now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass its going to the church of st john while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies whiteveiled nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the merryfaced boy she left in the moodylooking man beside her he was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and spiritlessnot sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him she couldnt understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the paglioni bridge and vanished in the church que pensez vous she said airing her french which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad that mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look she blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and told her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head she didnt like the new tone for though not blas it sounded indifferent in spite of the look if thats the way hes going to grow up i wish hed stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay at avigdors she found the precious homeletters and giving the reins to laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tearoses bloomed as freshly as in june beth is very poorly mother says i often think i ought to go home but they all say stay so i do for i shall never have another chance like this said amy looking sober over one page i think you are right there you could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear he drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on amys heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribblingsuit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words genius burns laurie smiled took it put it in his vestpocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter amy read him this will be a regularly merry christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought he found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a brightfaced girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene as they came up on to the stone plateau that crowns the hill amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there do you remember the cathedral and the corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to villa franca schuberts tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say is corsica i remember its not much changed he answered without enthusiasm what jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even napoleon now made interesting in his sight take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said amy seating herself ready for a good talk but she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the continent and been to greece so after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to mrs carrol laurie left them promising to return in the evening it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night time and absence had done its work on both the young people she had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective it must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies but dear heart we all have our little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities i do want him to think i look well and tell them so at home said amy to herself as she put on flos old white silk balldress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a hebelike knot at the back of her head its not the fashion but its becoming and i cant afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chassed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself my new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on aunts mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress if i only had a classical nose and mouth i should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand in spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away she seldom ranit did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante she walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one it so happened that she could not have done a better thing for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a wellplaced statue good evening diana said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her good evening apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonnaire and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart here are your flowers i arranged them myself remembering that you didnt like what hannah calls a sotbookay said laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in cardiglias window illustration here are your flowers how kind you are she exclaimed gratefully if id known you were coming id have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this im afraid thank you it isnt what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist please dont i thought you liked that sort of thing not from you it doesnt sound natural and i like your old bluntness better im glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home the company assembled in the long salle manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add lustre to their christmas ball a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like hamlets mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come for the supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour baron rothschilds private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his masters name crowned him with a golden halo a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight of course there were many lightfooted shrillvoiced american girls handsome lifelesslooking english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of travelling young gentlemen who disported themselves gayly while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters any young girl can imagine amys state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on lauries arm she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguishedlooking friend might be with the first burst of the band amys color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance one usually does at a ball her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible i meant the first dance may i have the honor i can give you one if i put off the count he dances divinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with nice little boy but rather a short pole to support a daughter of the gods divinely tall and most divinely fair was all the satisfaction she got however the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillon feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantula with a relish laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs of penitence she showed him her ballbook with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushing up to claim her for the next a glorious polkaredowa but his polite regrets didnt impose upon her and when she gallopaded away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moments rest her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant lauries eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of every one and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who couldnt admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth the air was dark with davises and many joneses gambolled like a flock of young giraffes the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train the serene teuton found the suppertable and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garons by the ravages he committed but the emperors friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an indiarubber ball he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shone his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellowmen like a french pickwick without glasses amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment it had been successful for at threeandtwenty blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion laurie had a wakedup look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good you look like balzacs femme peinte par ellemme he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffeecup in the other my rouge wont come off and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee illusion good name for it its very prettynew thing isnt it its as old as the hills you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till nowstupide i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see none of that it is forbidden id rather take coffee than compliments just now no dont lounge it makes me nervous laurie sat bolt upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irresistible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable wellthe general air the style the selfpossession thetheillusionyou know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word amy was gratified but of course didnt show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of ones self i study as well as play and as for thiswith a little gesture toward her dresswhy tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it wasnt in good taste but laurie liked her the better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly nor why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving illustration demi and daisy xxxviii on the shelf in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la libert becomes their motto in america as every one knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day im as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because im married not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored but three months passed and there was no return of repose meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gayly in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies if he hinted at a lecture or concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decided leave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him halfhelped if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above and when he read his paper of an evening demis colic got into the shippinglist and daisys fall affected the price of stocks for mrs brooke was only interested in domestic news the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles dotried to get a little comfort elsewhere scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end mrs scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbors society meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children but by and by when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressinggown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle yes she would say looking in the glass im getting old and ugly john doesnt find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances well the babies love me they dont care if i am thin and pale and havent time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what ive gladly sacrificed for them wont he my precious to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for megs drooping spirits had not escaped her observation i wouldnt tell any one except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on so much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs brooke drying her tears on daisys bib with an injured air goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously hes away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts it isnt fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement men are very selfish even the best of them so are women dont blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself but it cant be right for him to neglect me dont you neglect him why mother i thought youd take my part so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg i dont see how let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time no but i cant do it now with two babies to tend i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that its mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything meg drew her low chair beside her mothers and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever you have only made the mistake that most young wives makeforgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them ive seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time im afraid it wont if i ask him to stay hell think im jealous and i wouldnt insult him by such an idea he doesnt see that i want him and i dont know how to tell him without words make it so pleasant he wont want to go away my dear hes longing for his little home but it isnt home without you and you are always in the nursery oughtnt i to be there not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies dont neglect husband for children dont shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it his place is there as well as yours and the children need him let him feel that he has his part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all you really think so mother i know it meg for ive tried it and i seldom give advice unless ive proved its practicability when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i didnt do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me i nearly spoilt her by indulgence you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to get on without him since that is the secret of our home happiness he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours show me how ill do anything you say you always were my docile daughter well dear if i were you id let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and its none too soon to begin then id do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the sunshinemaker of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then id try to take an interest in whatever john likestalk with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way dont shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the worlds work for it all affects you and yours john is so sensible im afraid he will think im stupid if i ask questions about politics and things i dont believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he doesnt find your society far more agreeable than mrs scotts suppers i will poor john im afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given them to train dont let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should now dear goodby think over mothers preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son for demi inherited a trifle of his sires firmness of characterwe wont call it obstinacyand when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything all the kings horses and all the kings men could not change that pertinacious little mind mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all mammas lovepats a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment but unfortunately demis most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage so poor meg sung and rocked told stories and tried every sleepprovoking wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes wouldnt shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of goodnature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly wideawake expression of countenance will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the halldoor softly closed and the wellknown step went tiptoeing into the diningroom me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel no but ill save you some little cakies for breakfast if youll go byeby like daisy will you lovey iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight do you expect company only you dear is it a birthday anniversary or anything no im tired of being a dowdy so i dressed up as a change you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why shouldnt i when i have the time i do it out of respect to you my dear said oldfashioned john ditto ditto mr brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot well its altogether delightful and like old times this tastes right i drink your health dear and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the doorhandle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently opy doy mes tummin its that naughty boy i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death acold pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call illustration mornin now mornin now announced demi in a joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eying the cakies with loving glances no it isnt morning yet you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma then you can have the little cake with sugar on it me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys but john shook his head and said to meg if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you yes of course come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar now this wont do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner we shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly you have made a slave of yourself long enough give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it put him in his bed and leave him meg he wont stay there he never does unless i sit by him ill manage him demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you sant replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity you must never say that to papa i shall carry you if you dont go yourself go way me dont love parpar and demi retired to his mothers skirts for protection but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgmentday was at hand bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young mans strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to megs heart and she ran up to say beseechingly let me stay with him hell be good now john no my dear ive told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night but hell cry himself sick pleaded meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy no he wont hes so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind dont interfere ill manage him hes my child and i cant have his spirit broken by harshness hes my child and i wont have his temper spoilt by indulgence go down my dear and leave the boy to me when john spoke in that masterful tone meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility please let me kiss him once john certainly demi say goodnight to mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind poor little man hes worn out with sleep and crying ill cover him up and then go and set megs heart at rest thought john creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep but he wasnt for the moment his father peeped at him demis eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough mes dood now sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his fathers arm and holding his fathers finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and a wiser baby so held john had waited with womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole days work as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies he does know how to manage them and will be a great help for demi is getting too much for me when john came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that meg was such a transparent little person she couldnt keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clew would soon appear he read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet in her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when john paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity well i really dont see what we are coming to john laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken she is trying to like politics for my sake so ill try and like millinery for hers thats only fair thought john the just adding aloud thats very pretty is it what you call a breakfastcap illustration my dear man its a bonnet my dear man its a bonnet my very best gotoconcertandtheatre bonnet i beg your pardon it was so small i naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear how do you keep it on these bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible its a love of a bonnet but i prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and john kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin im glad you like it for i want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night i really need some music to put me in tune will you please of course i will with all my heart or anywhere else you like you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things what put it into your head little mother well i had a talk with marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt and she said i needed change and less care so hannah is to help me with the children and im to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety brokendown old woman before my time its only an experiment john and i want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because ive neglected you shamefully lately and im going to make home what it used to be if i can you dont object i hope never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin all that we have any business to know is that john did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates it was not all paradise by any means but every one was better for the division of labor system the children throve under the paternal rule for accurate steadfast john brought order and obedience into babydom while meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband home grew homelike again and john had no wish to leave it unless he took meg with him the scotts came to the brookes now and every one found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love even gay sallie moffatt liked to go there it is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid loneliness for there were no riotous sunnyfaced babies there and ned lived in a world of his own where there was no place for her this household happiness did not come all at once but john and meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real homelove and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy this is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old saxon word the houseband and learning as meg learned that a womans happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but a wise wife and mother illustration tailpiece illustration sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped xxxix lazy laurence laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month he was tired of wandering about alone and amys familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess they naturally took comfort in each others society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were halfconsciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sunk in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such halfsorrowful halfscornful surprise all the rest have gone to monaco for the day i preferred to stay at home and write letters they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon well yes but isnt it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without im going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so youll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie then ill go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp dont trouble yourself its no exertion to me but you dont look equal to it laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch the two never quarrelledamy was too wellbred and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air she answered with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beautyloving eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a barelegged shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek mousecolored donkeys laden with panniers of freshlycut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown softeyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olivetrees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passersby and lined the avenue winding through lemontrees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace whence one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the whitewalled city on its shore this is a regular honeymoon paradise isnt it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny creamcolored ones that starred the wall behind her she put them in his buttonhole as a peaceoffering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of halfsweet halfbitter melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american commonsense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came its good advice youd better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat very soon you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks i dare say short answers save trouble he expects you and you really ought to go hospitable creature i know it then why dont you do it natural depravity i suppose natural indolence you mean its really dreadful and amy looked severe not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again what are you doing just now watching lizards no no i mean what do you intend and wish to do smoke a cigarette if youll allow me how provoking you are i dont approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch i need a figure with all the pleasure in life how will you have mefulllength or threequarters on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente stay as you are and go to sleep if you like i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sisters name as usual go away teddy im busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on lauries facea hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the wellcut profile defined against the dark stone wish i was thats a foolish wish unless you have spoilt your life you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a halftimid halfwistful look more significant than her unfinished speech laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother its all right maam that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said im glad of that i didnt think youd been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked badenbaden lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour dont stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofacorner and told secrets illustration laurie threw himself down on the turf laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of amys hat that lay there im all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes ive none to tell you may begin havent one to bless myself with i thought perhaps youd had some news from home you have heard all that has come lately dont you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes shes very busy im roving about so its impossible to be regular you know when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it never she answered with a despondent but decided air rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair why should you with so much energy and talent thats just whybecause talent isnt genius and no amount of energy can make it so i want to be great or nothing i wont be a commonplace dauber so i dont intend to try any more and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and amys ambition had a good foundation laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a longcherished one died and spent no time lamenting good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now im going to play brother and ask questions may i i dont promise to answer your face will if your tongue wont you arent woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear i heard rumors about fred and you last year and its my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of ithey thats not for me to say was amys prim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very elderbrotherly and grave all of a sudden no but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down upon his knees wont you very likely then you are fond of old fred i could be if i tried but you dont intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence hes a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied youd like he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions i understand queens of society cant get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mothers girls true nevertheless a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain his look and silence as well as a certain inward selfdisapproval ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay i wish youd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply do it for me theres a dear girl i could if i tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style try then i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having some one to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime youd be angry in five minutes im never angry with you it takes two flints to make a fire you are as cool and soft as snow you dont know what i can do snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it stir away it wont hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began flo and i have got a new name for you its lazy laurence how do you like it she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable thats not bad thank you ladies do you want to know what i honestly think of you pining to be told well i despise you if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent of her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly why if you please because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable strong language mademoiselle if you like it ill go on pray do its quite interesting i thought youd find it so selfish people always like to talk about themselves am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one ill show you how for ive studied you while we have been frolicking and im not at all satisfied with you here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends isnt a fellow to have any pleasure after a fouryears grind you dont look as if youd had much at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see i said when we first met that you had improved now i take it all back for i dont think you half so nice as when i left you at home you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones with money talent position health and beautyah you like that old vanity but its the truth so i cant help saying itwith all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you might and ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence but the lecture began to take effect for there was a wideawake sparkle in his eyes now and a halfangry halfinjured expression replaced the former indifference i supposed youd take it so you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and wont listen which proves how much your flattery is worth amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and lauries voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly arent you ashamed of a hand like that its as soft and white as a womans and looks as if it never did anything but wear jouvins best gloves and pick flowers for ladies you are not a dandy thank heaven so im glad to see there are no diamonds or big sealrings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago dear soul i wish she was here to help me so do i the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in amys mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you werent the sweetesttempered fellow in the world youd be very angry with me but we are all so fond and proud of you i couldnt bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically no you didnt you knew perfectly well i never cared for any one but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo wouldnt be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly she was kind but not in the right way and its lucky for her she didnt love me if im the goodfornothing fellow you think me its her fault though and you may tell her so the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply i was wrong i didnt know im very sorry i was so cross but i cant help wishing youd bear it better teddy dear dont thats her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in jos halfkind halfreproachful tone wait till youve tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful id take it manfully and be respected if i couldnt be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone amys lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do yes if she saw you now she hates lazy people why dont you do something splendid and make her love you i did my best but it was no use graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your grandfathers sake it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when every one knew you could do well i did fail say what you will for jo wouldnt love me began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude no you didnt and youll say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried if youd only set about another task of some sort youd soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble thats impossible try it and see you neednt shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things i dont pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than youd imagine im interested in other peoples experiences and inconsistencies and though i cant explain i remember and use them for my own benefit love jo all your days if you choose but dont let it spoil you for its wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you cant have the one you want there i wont lecture any more for i know youll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl neither spoke for several minutes laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally donethe long lazy figure on the grass with listless face halfshut eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamers head how well you draw he said with genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a halflaugh yes thats me as you are this is as you were and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young mans face as he looked only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him in the ruffled mane the riders breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way illustration a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse dont you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you much obliged youve improved immensely since then and i congratulate you may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five oclock is the dinnerhour at your hotel laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more efficacious than he would confess amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself now ive offended him well if it does him good im glad if it makes him hate me im sorry but its true and i cant take back a word of it they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptiste up behind thought that monsieur and mademoiselle were in charming spirits but both felt ill at ease the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gayety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each shall we see you this evening mon frre asked amy as they parted at her aunts door unfortunately i have an engagement au revoir mademoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly no be yourself with me laurie and part in the good old way id rather have a hearty english handshake than all the sentimental salutations in france goodby dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end my dear mentor please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for lazy laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys a pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa i think fred would be benefited by a rouser tell him so with my congratulations yours gratefully telemachus good boy im glad hes gone said amy with an approving smile the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh yes i am glad but how i shall miss him illustration the valley of the shadow xl the valley of the shadow when the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth and in it was gathered everything that she most lovedflowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies fathers best books found their way there mothers easychair jos desk amys finest sketches and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for aunty beth john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind the feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the schoolchildren daily passing to and froto drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for pictureloving eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers up the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs if beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude the first few months were very happy ones and beth often used to look round and say how beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the fathers heart was in the ministers religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read it was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for by and by beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh ah me such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry help me help me and to feel that there was no help a sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever with the wreck of her frail body beths soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the shining ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river jo never left her for an hour since beth had said i feel stronger when you are here she slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble all day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her precious and helpful hours to jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly often when she woke jo found beth reading in her wellworn little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well seeing this did more for jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter for with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her sisters lifeuneventful unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the selfforgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite pilgrims progress she found a little paper scribbled over in jos hand the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it poor jo shes fast asleep so i wont wake her to ask leave she shows me all her things and i dont think shell mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart my beth sitting patient in the shadow till the blessed light shall come a serene and saintly presence sanctifies our troubled home earthly joys and hopes and sorrows break like ripples on the strand of the deep and solemn river where her willing feet now stand o my sister passing from me out of human care and strife leave me as a gift those virtues which have beautified your life dear bequeath me that great patience which has power to sustain a cheerful uncomplaining spirit in its prisonhouse of pain give me for i need it sorely of that courage wise and sweet which has made the path of duty green beneath your willing feet give me that unselfish nature that with charity divine can pardon wrong for loves dear sake meek heart forgive me mine thus our parting daily loseth something of its bitter pain and while learning this hard lesson my great loss becomes my gain for the touch of grief will render my wild nature more serene give to life new aspirations a new trust in the unseen henceforth safe across the river i shall see forevermore a beloved household spirit waiting for me on the shore hope and faith born of my sorrow guardian angels shall become and the sister gone before me by their hands shall lead me home blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to beths face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared as she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping beth slept not asleep but so happy dear see i found this and read it i knew you wouldnt care have i been all that to you jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness o beth so much so much and jos head went down upon the pillow beside her sisters then i dont feel as if id wasted my life im not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right and now when its too late to begin even to do better its such a comfort to know that some one loves me so much and feels as if id helped them more than any one in the world beth i used to think i couldnt let you go but im learning to feel that i dont lose you that youll be more to me than ever and death cant part us though it seems to i know it cannot and i dont fear it any longer for im sure i shall be your beth still to love and help you more than ever you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when im gone they will turn to you dont fail them and if its hard to work alone remember that i dont forget you and that youll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the end so easy ill try beth and then and there jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love so the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fair and early and the birds came back in time to say goodby to beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as father and mother guided her tenderly through the valley of the shadow and gave her up to god seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep as beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before the dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh with tears and prayers and tender hands mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out jos place was empty and the room was very still but a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillowa face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked god that beth was well at last illustration tailpiece illustration sat staring up at the busts xli learning to forget amys lecture did laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation dont take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it if it fails they generously give her the whole laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again there was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression i despise you go and do something splendid that will make her love you laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down he felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously jo wouldnt love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girls no had not spoilt his life he had always meant to do something and amys advice was quite unnecessary he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred that being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on as goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so laurie resolved to embalm his lovesorrow in music and compose a requiem which should harrow up jos soul and melt the heart of every hearer therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself but whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the requiem was beyond him just at present it was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the christmas ball at nice especially the stout frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him he wanted jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love but memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall jos oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental aspectsbeating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna barricading herself with the sofapillow or throwing cold water over his passion la gummidgeand an irresistible laugh spoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint jo wouldnt be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer when he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness this phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his minds eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons he did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself its genius simmering perhaps ill let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasnt genius but something far more common whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved music was not a composer returning from one of mozarts grand operas splendidly performed at the royal theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring up at the busts of mendelssohn beethoven and bach who stared benignly back again then suddenly he tore up his musicsheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself she is right talent isnt genius and you cant make it so that music has taken the vanity out of me as rome took it out of her and i wont be a humbug any longer now what shall i do that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say alls well kept him safe and steady very likely some mrs grundy will observe i dont believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles i dare say you dont mrs grundy but its true nevertheless women work a good many miracles and i have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must but mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good womens eyes if it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and couldnt understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us lauries heart wouldnt ache the wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember he had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it he was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end as the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of these reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him well he was a great man and when he couldnt have one sister he took the other and was happy laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself no i wont i havent forgotten i never can ill try again and if that fails why then leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind couldnt she wouldnt she and let him come home and be happy while waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience it came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for jo decidedly couldnt and wouldnt she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always to keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister jo in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay that would be time enough please god but laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious so i will at once poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her im afraid and laurie opened his desk as if writing to amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before but he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of jos letters and in another compartment were three notes from amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside with a halfrepentant halfamused expression laurie gathered up all jos letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear high mass at saint stefans feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies illustration turning the ring thoughtfully upon his finger the letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner the correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to paris hoping somebody would arrive before long he wanted desperately to go to nice but would not till he was asked and amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of our boy fred vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer yes thank you but now she said no thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears the words fred is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and lauries face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly she didnt want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature she didnt care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman she was so glad he didnt hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and were not half so satisfactory as his when they did come it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him it couldnt be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are amy never lectured now she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sisters pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to hera stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curlyhaired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air i was sure she would think better of it poor old fellow ive been through it all and i can sympathize with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed amys letter luxuriously while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister the sad news met her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodby to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellowpedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension the garon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blond mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden if monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen beforethe tender side of amys character everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrowthe blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing o laurie laurie i knew youd come to me illustration o laurie laurie i knew youd come i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill jos place and make him happy he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry wellworn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting i couldnt help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you wouldnt come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally i came the minute i heard i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and he could not get any further for he too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say he longed to lay amys head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words you neednt say anything this comforts me she said softly beth is well and happy and i mustnt wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all we wont talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay you neednt go right back need you not if you want me dear i do so much aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she wantedthe petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed poor little soul you look as if youd grieved yourself halfsick im going to take care of you so dont cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the halfcaressing halfcommanding way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the newleaved chestnuts he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it very pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinnerbell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden the moment mrs carrol saw the girls altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it allthe child has been pining for young laurence bless my heart i never thought of such a thing with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the rapid cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that jos sister was almost the same as jos self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the bittersweet experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance he had rather imagined that the dnouement would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorous manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like whitewinged gulls they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his hloise neither had read it but they knew it was a lovestory and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something you must be tired rest a little and let me row it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious im not tired but you may take an oar if you like theres room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat wont trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangement feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water illustration how well we pull together how well we pull together dont we said amy who objected to silence just then so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat will you amy very tenderly yes laurie very low then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake xlii all alone it was easy to promise selfabnegation when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but loneliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier i cant do it i wasnt meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody dont come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable but some one did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of an unsubmissive sorrow o beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sisters faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than jos and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went handinhand with natural sorrow sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthened love feeling this jos burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her mothers arms when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth i need it more than she did for im all wrong my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask it illustration jo and her father then sitting in beths little chair close beside him jo told her troublesthe resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power other helps had johumble wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger round the little mop and the old brush that was never thrown away as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating beths orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cosey which was the first step toward making home happy though she didnt know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand you thoughtful creter youre determined we shant miss that dear lamb ef you can help it we dont say much but we see it and the lord will bless you fort see ef he dont as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other marriage is an excellent thing after all i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the topsyturvy nursery its just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature jo you are like a chestnutburr prickly outside but silkysoft within and a sweet kernel if one can only get at it love will make you show your heart some day and then the rough burr will fall off frost opens chestnutburrs maam and it takes a good shake to bring them down boys go nutting and i dont care to be bagged by them returned jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for daisy had tied herself on as a bob meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of jos old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of megs most effective arguments were the babies whom jo loved tenderly grief is the best opener for some hearts and jos was nearly ready for the bag a little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a boys impatient shake but a mans hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernel sound and sweet if she had suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she wasnt thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket but you see jo wasnt a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested its highly virtuous to say well be good but we cant do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfullyah that was another thing she had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her and if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others providence had taken her at her word here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it now could she do it she decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called difficulty why dont you write that always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit overshadowed jo ive no heart to write and if i had nobody cares for my things we do write something for us and never mind the rest of the world try it dear im sure it would do you good and please us very much dont believe i can but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her halffinished manuscripts an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused mrs march to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it for a small thing it was a great success and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once i dont understand it what can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered there is truth in it jo thats the secret humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last you wrote with no thought of fame or money and put your heart into it my daughter you have had the bitter now comes the sweet do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success if there is anything good or true in what i write it isnt mine i owe it all to you and mother and to beth said jo more touched by her fathers words than by any amount of praise from the world so taught by love and sorrow jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for though jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice it was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a word to me mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled im not the scatterbrain i was you may trust me im sober and sensible enough for any ones confidante now so you are dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved any one else now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after id refused his love when it was freshest if not best i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer forgive me dear i cant help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now no mother it is better as it is and im glad amy has learned to love him but you are right in one thing i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away im glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward mothers are the best lovers in the world but i dont mind whispering to marmee that id like to try all kinds its very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want id no idea hearts could take in so many mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family i dont understand it i do and mrs march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me he isnt sentimental doesnt say much about it but i see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that i dont seem to be the same girl i was i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know its mine he says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast i pray he may and try to be all he believes me for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while god lets us be together o mother i never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another and thats our cool reserved and worldly amy truly love does work miracles how very very happy they must be and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again by and by jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing it was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and amys happiness woke the hungry longing for some one to love with heart and soul and cling to while god let them be together up in the garret where jos unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercisebooks caught her eye she drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind mrs kirkes she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the professors hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as if they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart wait for me my friend i may be a little late but i shall surely come oh if he only would so kind so good so patient with me always my dear old fritz i didnt value him half enough when i had him but now how i should love to see him for every one seems going away from me and im all alone and holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled jo laid her head down on a comfortable ragbag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof illustration jo laid her head on a comfortable ragbag and cried was it all selfpity loneliness or low spirits or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer who shall say illustration a substantial lifelike ghost leaning over her xliii surprises jo was alone in the twilight lying on the old sofa looking at the fire and thinking it was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk no one disturbed her and she used to lie there on beths little red pillow planning stories dreaming dreams or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away her face looked tired grave and rather sad for tomorrow was her birthday and she was thinking how fast the years went by how old she was getting and how little she seemed to have accomplished almost twentyfive and nothing to show for it jo was mistaken in that there was a good deal to show and by and by she saw and was grateful for it an old maid thats what im to be a literary spinster with a pen for a spouse a family of stories for children and twenty years hence a morsel of fame perhaps when like poor johnson im old and cant enjoy it solitary and cant share it independent and dont need it well i neednt be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner and i dare say old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it but and there jo sighed as if the prospect was not inviting it seldom is at first and thirty seems the end of all things to fiveandtwenty but its not so bad as it looks and one can get on quite happily if one has something in ones self to fall back upon at twentyfive girls begin to talk about being old maids but secretly resolve that they never will be at thirty they say nothing about it but quietly accept the fact and if sensible console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful happy years in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully dont laugh at the spinsters dear girls for often very tender tragical romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns and many silent sacrifices of youth health ambition love itself make the faded faces beautiful in gods sight even the sad sour sisters should be kindly dealt with because they have missed the sweetest part of life if for no other reason and looking at them with compassion not contempt girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time that rosy cheeks dont last forever that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair and that by and by kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now gentlemen which means boys be courteous to the old maids no matter how poor and plain and prim for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old protect the feeble and serve womankind regardless of rank age or color just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed but nursed and petted too often without thanks the scrapes they have helped you out of the tips they have given you from their small store the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you the steps the willing old feet have taken and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live the brighteyed girls are quick to see such traits and will like you all the better for them and if death almost the only power that can part mother and son should rob you of yours you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for the the best nevvy in the world jo must have fallen asleep as i dare say my reader has during this little homily for suddenly lauries ghost seemed to stand before hera substantial lifelike ghostleaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didnt like to show it but like jenny in the ballad she could not think it he and lay staring up at him in startled silence till he stooped and kissed her then she knew him and flew up crying joyfully o my teddy o my teddy dear jo you are glad to see me then glad my blessed boy words cant express my gladness wheres amy your mother has got her down at megs we stopped there by the way and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches your what cried jo for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him oh the dickens now ive done it and he looked so guilty that jo was down upon him like a flash youve gone and got married yes please but i never will again and he went down upon his knees with a penitent clasping of hands and a face full of mischief mirth and triumph actually married very much so thank you mercy on us what dreadful thing will you do next and jo fell into her seat with a gasp a characteristic but not exactly complimentary congratulation returned laurie still in an abject attitude but beaming with satisfaction what can you expect when you take ones breath away creeping in like a burglar and letting cats out of bags like that get up you ridiculous boy and tell me all about it not a word unless you let me come in my old place and promise not to barricade jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day and patted the sofa invitingly as she said in a cordial tone the old pillow is up garret and we dont need it now so come and fess teddy how good it sounds to hear you say teddy no one ever calls me that but you and laurie sat down with an air of great content what does amy call you my lord thats like her well you look it and jos eyes plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever the pillow was gone but there was a barricade neverthelessa natural one raised by time absence and change of heart both felt it and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them it was gone directly however for laurie said with a vain attempt at dignity dont i look like a married man and the head of a family not a bit and you never will youve grown bigger and bonnier but you are the same scapegrace as ever now really jo you ought to treat me with more respect began laurie who enjoyed it all immensely how can i when the mere idea of you married and settled is so irresistibly funny that i cant keep sober answered jo smiling all over her face so infectiously that they had another laugh and then settled down for a good talk quite in the pleasant old fashion its no use your going out in the cold to get amy for they are all coming up presently i couldnt wait i wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise and have first skim as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream of course you did and spoilt your story by beginning at the wrong end now start right and tell me how it all happened im pining to know well i did it to please amy began laurie with a twinkle that made jo exclaim fib number one amy did it to please you go on and tell the truth if you can sir now shes beginning to marm it isnt it jolly to hear her said laurie to the fire and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed its all the same you know she and i being one we planned to come home with the carrols a month or more ago but they suddenly changed their minds and decided to pass another winter in paris but grandpa wanted to come home he went to please me and i couldnt let him go alone neither could i leave amy and mrs carrol had got english notions about chaperons and such nonsense and wouldnt let amy come with us so i just settled the difficulty by saying lets be married and then we can do as we like of course you did you always have things to suit you not always and something in lauries voice made jo say hastily how did you ever get aunt to agree it was hard work but between us we talked her over for we had heaps of good reasons on our side there wasnt time to write and ask leave but you all liked it had consented to it by and by and it was only taking time by the fetlock as my wife says arent we proud of those two words and dont we like to say them interrupted jo addressing the fire in her turn and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last a trifle perhaps shes such a captivating little woman i cant help being proud of her well then uncle and aunt were there to play propriety we were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round so we did it when where how asked jo in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity for she could not realize it a particle six weeks ago at the american consuls in paris a very quiet wedding of course for even in our happiness we didnt forget dear little beth jo put her hand in his as he said that and laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow which he remembered well why didnt you let us know afterward asked jo in a quieter tone when they had sat quite still a minute we wanted to surprise you we thought we were coming directly home at first but the dear old gentleman as soon as we were married found he couldnt be ready under a month at least and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked amy had once called valrosa a regular honeymoon home so we went there and were as happy as people are but once in their lives my faith wasnt it love among the roses laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute and jo was glad of it for the fact that he told her these things so freely and naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten she tried to draw away her hand but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the halfinvoluntary impulse laurie held it fast and said with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before jo dear i want to say one thing and then well put it by forever as i told you in my letter when i wrote that amy had been so kind to me i never shall stop loving you but the love is altered and i have learned to see that it is better as it is amy and you change places in my heart thats all i think it was meant to be so and would have come about naturally if i had waited as you tried to make me but i never could be patient and so i got a heartache i was a boy then headstrong and violent and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake for it was one jo as you said and i found it out after making a fool of myself upon my word i was so tumbled up in my mind at one time that i didnt know which i loved best you or amy and tried to love both alike but i couldnt and when i saw her in switzerland everything seemed to clear up all at once you both got into your right places and i felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new that i could honestly share my heart between sister jo and wife amy and love them both dearly will you believe it and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another ill believe it with all my heart but teddy we never can be boy and girl again the happy old times cant come back and we mustnt expect it we are man and woman now with sober work to do for playtime is over and we must give up frolicking im sure you feel this i see the change in you and youll find it in me i shall miss my boy but i shall love the man as much and admire him more because he means to be what i hoped he would we cant be little playmates any longer but we will be brother and sister to love and help one another all our lives wont we laurie he did not say a word but took the hand she offered him and laid his face down on it for a minute feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion there had risen a beautiful strong friendship to bless them both presently jo said cheerfully for she didnt want the coming home to be a sad one i cant make it true that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping why it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning amys pinafore and pulling your hair when you teased mercy me how time does fly as one of the children is older than yourself you neednt talk so like a grandma i flatter myself im a gentleman growed as peggotty said of david and when you see amy youll find her rather a precocious infant said laurie looking amused at her maternal air you may be a little older in years but im ever so much older in feeling teddy women always are and this last year has been such a hard one that i feel forty poor jo we left you to bear it alone while we went pleasuring you are older heres a line and theres another unless you smile your eyes look sad and when i touched the cushion just now i found a tear on it youve had a great deal to bear and had to bear it all alone what a selfish beast ive been and laurie pulled his own hair with a remorseful look but jo only turned over the traitorous pillow and answered in a tone which she tried to make quite cheerful no i had father and mother to help me the dear babies to comfort me and the thought that you and amy were safe and happy to make the troubles here easier to bear i am lonely sometimes but i dare say its good for me and you never shall be again broke in laurie putting his arm about her as if to fence out every human ill amy and i cant get on without you so you must come and teach the children to keep house and go halves in everything just as we used to do and let us pet you and all be blissfully happy and friendly together if i shouldnt be in the way it would be very pleasant i begin to feel quite young already for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came you always were a comfort teddy and jo leaned her head on his shoulder just as she did years ago when beth lay ill and laurie told her to hold on to him he looked down at her wondering if she remembered the time but jo was smiling to herself as if in truth her troubles had all vanished at his coming you are the same jo still dropping tears about one minute and laughing the next you look a little wicked now what is it grandma i was wondering how you and amy get on together like angels yes of course at first but which rules i dont mind telling you that she does now at least i let her think soit pleases her you know by and by we shall take turns for marriage they say halves ones rights and doubles ones duties youll go on as you begin and amy will rule you all the days of your life well she does it so imperceptibly that i dont think i shall mind much she is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well in fact i rather like it for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it cried jo with uplifted hands it was good to see laurie square his shoulders and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation as he replied with his high and mighty air amy is too wellbred for that and i am not the sort of man to submit to it my wife and i respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel jo liked that and thought the new dignity very becoming but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man and regret mingled with her pleasure i am sure of that amy and you never did quarrel as we used to she is the sun and i the wind in the fable and the sun managed the man best you remember she can blow him up as well as shine on him laughed laurie such a lecture as i got at nice i give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldingsa regular rouser ill tell you all about it sometimeshe never will because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the goodfornothing what baseness well if she abuses you come to me and ill defend you i look as if i needed it dont i said laurie getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous as amys voice was heard calling where is she wheres my dear old jo in trooped the whole family and every one was hugged and kissed all over again and after several vain attempts the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over mr laurence hale and hearty as ever was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone and the oldfashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever it was good to see him beam at my children as he called the young pair it was better still to see amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart and best of all to watch laurie revolve about the two as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made the minute she put her eyes upon amy meg became conscious that her own dress hadnt a parisian air that young mrs moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young mrs laurence and that her ladyship was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman jo thought as she watched the pair how well they look together i was right and laurie has found the beautiful accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old jo and be a pride not a torment to him mrs march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces for they saw that their youngest had done well not only in worldly things but the better wealth of love confidence and happiness for amys face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart her voice had a new tenderness in it and the cool prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity both womanly and winning no little affectations marred it and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become love has done much for our little girl said her mother softly she has had a good example before her all her life my dear mr march whispered back with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her pitty aunty but attached herself like a lapdog to the wonderful chtelaine full of delightful charms demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from berne a flank movement produced an unconditional surrender however for laurie knew where to have him young man when i first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face now i demand the satisfaction of a gentleman and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul illustration the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew blest if she aint in silk from head to foot aint it a relishin sight to see her settin there as fine as a fiddle and hear folks calling little amy mis laurence muttered old hannah who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner mercy on us how they did talk first one then the other then all burst out together trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour it was fortunate that tea was at hand to produce a lull and provide refreshment for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer such a happy procession as filed away into the little diningroom mr march proudly escorted mrs laurence mrs march as proudly leaned on the arm of my son the old gentleman took jo with a whispered you must be my girl now and a glance at the empty corner by the fire that made jo whisper back with trembling lips ill try to fill her place sir the twins pranced behind feeling that the millennium was at hand for every one was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity didnt they steal sips of tea stuff gingerbread ab libitum get a hot biscuit apiece and as a crowning trespass didnt they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets there to stick and crumble treacherously teaching them that both human nature and pastry are frail burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts and fearing that dodos sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty the little sinners attached themselves to dranpa who hadnt his spectacles on amy who was handed about like refreshments returned to the parlor on father laurences arm the others paired off as before and this arrangement left jo companionless she did not mind it at the minute for she lingered to answer hannahs eager inquiry will miss amy ride in her coop coup and use all them lovely silver dishes thats stored away over yander shouldnt wonder if she drove six white horses ate off gold plate and wore diamonds and pointlace every day teddy thinks nothing too good for her returned jo with infinite satisfaction no more there is will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast asked hannah who wisely mingled poetry and prose i dont care and jo shut the door feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then she stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above and as demis short plaid legs toiled up the last stair a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes as if to find something to lean upon for even teddy had deserted her if she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer she would not have said to herself ill weep a little weep when i go to bed it wont do to be dismal now then she drew her hand over her eyesfor one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief wasand had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porchdoor she opened it with hospitable haste and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her for there stood a tall bearded gentleman beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun o mr bhaer i am so glad to see you cried jo with a clutch as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in illustration o mr bhaer i am so glad to see you and i to see miss marschbut no you haf a party and the professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them no we havent only the family my sister and friends have just come home and we are all very happy come in and make one of us though a very social man i think mr bhaer would have gone decorously away and come again another day but how could he when jo shut the door behind him and bereft him of his hat perhaps her face had something to do with it for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes if i shall not be monsieur de trop i will so gladly see them all you haf been ill my friend he put the question abruptly for as jo hung up his coat the light fell on her face and he saw a change in it not ill but tired and sorrowful we have had trouble since i saw you last ah yes i know my heart was sore for you when i heard that and he shook hands again with such a sympathetic face that jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes the grasp of the big warm hand father mother this is my friend professor bhaer she said with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish if the stranger had had any doubts about his reception they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received every one greeted him kindly for jos sake at first but very soon they liked him for his own they could not help it for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts and these simple people warmed to him at once feeling even the more friendly because he was poor for poverty enriches those who live above it and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits mr bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveller who knocks at a strange door and when it opens finds himself at home the children went to him like bees to a honeypot and establishing themselves on each knee proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets pulling his beard and investigating his watch with juvenile audacity the women telegraphed their approval to one another and mr march feeling that he had got a kindred spirit opened his choicest stores for his guests benefit while silent john listened and enjoyed the talk but said not a word and mr laurence found it impossible to go to sleep if jo had not been otherwise engaged lauries behavior would have amused her for a faint twinge not of jealousy but something like suspicion caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection but it did not last long he got interested in spite of himself and before he knew it was drawn into the circle for mr bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere and did himself justice he seldom spoke to laurie but he looked at him often and a shadow would pass across his face as if regretting his own lost youth as he watched the young man in his prime then his eye would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it but jo had her own eyes to take care of and feeling that they could not be trusted she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting like a model maiden aunt a stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens mr bhaers face had lost the absentminded expression and looked all alive with interest in the present moment actually young and handsome she thought forgetting to compare him with laurie as she usually did strange men to their great detriment then he seemed quite inspired though the burial customs of the ancients to which the conversation had strayed might not be considered an exhilarating topic jo quite glowed with triumph when teddy got quenched in an argument and thought to herself as she watched her fathers absorbed face how he would enjoy having such a man as my professor to talk with every day lastly mr bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black which made him look more like a gentleman than ever his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed but didnt stay in order long for in exciting moments he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat because she thought it gave his fine forehead a jovelike aspect poor jo how she did glorify that plain man as she sat knitting away so quietly yet letting nothing escape her not even the fact that mr bhaer actually had gold sleevebuttons in his immaculate wristbands dear old fellow he couldnt have got himself up with more care if hed been going awooing said jo to herself and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball and go down after it to hide her face the manuvre did not succeed as well as she expected however for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeralpile the professor dropped his torch metaphorically speaking and made a dive after the little blue ball of course they bumped their heads smartly together saw stars and both came up flushed and laughing without the ball to resume their seats wishing they had not left them nobody knew where the evening went to for hannah skilfully abstracted the babies at an early hour nodding like two rosy poppies and mr laurence went home to rest the others sat round the fire talking away utterly regardless of the lapse of time till meg whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that daisy had tumbled out of bed and demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches made a move to go we must have our sing in the good old way for we are all together again once more said jo feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul they were not all there but no one found the words thoughtless or untrue for beth still seemed among them a peaceful presence invisible but dearer than ever since death could not break the household league that love made indissoluble the little chair stood in its old place the tidy basket with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew so heavy was still on its accustomed shelf the beloved instrument seldom touched now had not been moved and above it beths face serene and smiling as in the early days looked down upon them seeming to say be happy i am here play something amy let them hear how much you have improved said laurie with pardonable pride in his promising pupil but amy whispered with full eyes as she twirled the faded stool not tonight dear i cant show off tonight but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill for she sung beths songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught and touched the listeners hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her the room was very still when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of beths favorite hymn it was hard to say earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal and amy leaned against her husband who stood behind her feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without beths kiss now we must finish with mignons song for mr bhaer sings that said jo before the pause grew painful and mr bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified hem as he stepped into the corner where jo stood saying you will sing with me we go excellently well together a pleasing fiction by the way for jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper but she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera and warbled away blissfully regardless of time and tune it didnt much matter for mr bhaer sang like a true german heartily and well and jo soon subsided into a subdued hum that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone illustration mr bhaer sang heartily knowst thou the land where the citron blooms used to be the professors favorite line for das land meant germany to him but now he seemed to dwell with peculiar warmth and melody upon the words there oh there might i with thee o my beloved go and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked the song was considered a great success and the singer retired covered with laurels but a few minutes afterward he forgot his manners entirely and stared at amy putting on her bonnet for she had been introduced simply as my sister and no one had called her by her new name since he came he forgot himself still further when laurie said in his most gracious manner at parting my wife and i are very glad to meet you sir please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way then the professor thanked him so heartily and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met i too shall go but i shall gladly come again if you will gif me leave dear madame for a little business in the city will keep me here some days he spoke to mrs march but he looked at jo and the mothers voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughters eyes for mrs march was not so blind to her childrens interest as mrs moffat supposed i suspect that is a wise man remarked mr march with placid satisfaction from the hearthrug after the last guest had gone i know he is a good one added mrs march with decided approval as she wound up the clock i thought youd like him was all jo said as she slipped away to her bed she wondered what the business was that brought mr bhaer to the city and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor somewhere but had been too modest to mention the fact if she had seen his face when safe in his own room he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady with a good deal of hair who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity it might have thrown some light upon the subject especially when he turned off the gas and kissed the picture in the dark illustration mrs laurence sitting in her mothers lap xliv my lord and lady please madam mother could you lend me my wife for half an hour the luggage has come and ive been making hay of amys paris finery trying to find some things i want said laurie coming in the next day to find mrs laurence sitting in her mothers lap as if being made the baby again certainly go dear i forget that you have any home but this and mrs march pressed the white hand that wore the weddingring as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness i shouldnt have come over if i could have helped it but i cant get on without my little woman any more than a weathercock can without wind suggested jo as he paused for a simile jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since teddy came home exactly for amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time with only an occasional whiffle round to the south and i havent had an easterly spell since i was married dont know anything about the north but am altogether salubrious and balmy hey my lady lovely weather so far i dont know how long it will last but im not afraid of storms for im learning how to sail my ship come home dear and ill find your bootjack i suppose thats what you are rummaging after among my things men are so helpless mother said amy with a matronly air which delighted her husband what are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled asked jo buttoning amys cloak as she used to button her pinafores we have our plans we dont mean to say much about them yet because we are such very new brooms but we dont intend to be idle im going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather and prove to him that im not spoilt i need something of the sort to keep me steady im tired of dawdling and mean to work like a man and amy what is she going to do asked mrs march well pleased at lauries decision and the energy with which he spoke after doing the civil all round and airing our best bonnet we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion the brilliant society we shall draw about us and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large thats about it isnt it madame rcamier asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy time will show come away impertinence and dont shock my family by calling me names before their faces answered amy resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society how happy those children seem together observed mr march finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone yes and i think it will last added mrs march with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port i know it will happy amy and jo sighed then smiled brightly as professor bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push later in the evening when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack laurie said suddenly to his wife who was flitting about arranging her new art treasures mrs laurence my lord that man intends to marry our jo i hope so dont you dear well my love i consider him a trump in the fullest sense of that expressive word but i do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer now laurie dont be too fastidious and worldlyminded if they love one another it doesnt matter a particle how old they are nor how poor women never should marry for money amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her and looked at her husband who replied with malicious gravity certainly not though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes if my memory serves me you once thought it your duty to make a rich match that accounts perhaps for your marrying a goodfornothing like me o my dearest boy dont dont say that i forgot you were rich when i said yes id have married you if you hadnt a penny and i sometimes wish you were poor that i might show how much i love you and amy who was very dignified in public and very fond in private gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words you dont really think i am such a mercenary creature as i tried to be once do you it would break my heart if you didnt believe that id gladly pull in the same boat with you even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake am i an idiot and a brute how could i think so when you refused a richer man for me and wont let me give you half i want to now when i have the right girls do it every day poor things and are taught to think it is their only salvation but you had better lessons and though i trembled for you at one time i was not disappointed for the daughter was true to the mothers teaching i told mamma so yesterday and she looked as glad and grateful as if id given her a check for a million to be spent in charity you are not listening to my moral remarks mrs laurence and laurie paused for amys eyes had an absent look though fixed upon his face yes i am and admiring the dimple in your chin at the same time i dont wish to make you vain but i must confess that im prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money dont laugh but your nose is such a comfort to me and amy softly caressed the wellcut feature with artistic satisfaction laurie had received many compliments in his life but never one that suited him better as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wifes peculiar taste while she said slowly may i ask you a question dear of course you may shall you care if jo does marry mr bhaer oh thats the trouble is it i thought there was something in the dimple that didnt suit you not being a dog in the manger but the happiest fellow alive i assure you i can dance at jos wedding with a heart as light as my heels do you doubt it my darling amy looked up at him and was satisfied her last little jealous fear vanished forever and she thanked him with a face full of love and confidence i wish we could do something for that capital old professor couldnt we invent a rich relation who shall obligingly die out there in germany and leave him a tidy little fortune said laurie when they began to pace up and down the long drawingroom arminarm as they were fond of doing in memory of the chateau garden illustration they began to pace up and down jo would find us out and spoil it all she is very proud of him just as he is and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing bless her dear heart she wont think so when she has a literary husband and a dozen little professors and professorins to support we wont interfere now but watch our chance and do them a good turn in spite of themselves i owe jo for a part of my education and she believes in peoples paying their honest debts so ill get round her in that way how delightful it is to be able to help others isnt it that was always one of my dreams to have the power of giving freely and thanks to you the dream has come true ah well do quantities of good wont we theres one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help outandout beggars get taken care of but poor gentlefolks fare badly because they wont ask and people dont dare to offer charity yet there are a thousand ways of helping them if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend i must say i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarneying beggar i suppose its wrong but i do though it is harder because it takes a gentleman to do it added the other member of the domestic admiration society thank you im afraid i dont deserve that pretty compliment but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices and enduring real hardships that they might realize their dreams splendid fellows some of them working like heroes poor and friendless but so full of courage patience and ambition that i was ashamed of myself and longed to give them a right good lift those are people whom its a satisfaction to help for if theyve got genius its an honor to be allowed to serve them and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling if they havent its a pleasure to comfort the poor souls and keep them from despair when they find it out yes indeed and theres another class who cant ask and who suffer in silence i know something of it for i belonged to it before you made a princess of me as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story ambitious girls have a hard time laurie and often have to see youth health and precious opportunities go by just for want of a little help at the right minute people have been very kind to me and whenever i see girls struggling along as we used to do i want to put out my hand and help them as i was helped and so you shall like an angel as you are cried laurie resolving with a glow of philanthropic zeal to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves or let their money accumulate for others to waste its not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive and enjoy making ones fellowcreatures happy with it well have a good time ourselves and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste will you be a little dorcas going about emptying a big basket of comforts and filling it up with good deeds with all my heart if you will be a brave st martin stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar its a bargain and we shall get the best of it so the young pair shook hands upon it and then paced happily on again feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them if they smoothed rough ways for other feet and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they illustration tailpiece xlv daisy and demi i cannot feel that i have done my duty as humble historian of the march family without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it daisy and demi had now arrived at years of discretion for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights and get them too which is more than many of their elders do if there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoilt by adoration it was these prattling brookes of course they were the most remarkable children ever born as will be shown when i mention that they walked at eight months talked fluently at twelve months and at two years they took their places at table and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders at three daisy demanded a needler and actually made a bag with four stitches in it she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard and managed a microscopic cookingstove with a skill that brought tears of pride to hannahs eyes while demi learned his letters with his grandfather who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming the letters with his arms and legs thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels the boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother for he tried to imitate every machine he saw and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition with his sewinsheena mysterious structure of string chairs clothespins and spools for wheels to go wound and wound also a basket hung over the back of a big chair in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister who with feminine devotion allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued when the young inventor indignantly remarked why marmar dats my lellywaiter and mes trying to pull her up though utterly unlike in character the twins got on remarkably well together and seldom quarrelled more than thrice a day of course demi tyrannized over daisy and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor while daisy made a galleyslave of herself and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world a rosy chubby sunshiny little soul was daisy who found her way to everybodys heart and nestled there one of the captivating children who seem made to be kissed and cuddled adorned and adored like little goddesses and produced for general approval on all festive occasions her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human it was all fair weather in her world and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out and say no matter whether it rained or shone oh pitty day oh pitty day every one was a friend and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented and babylovers became faithful worshippers illustration me loves evvybody me loves evvybody she once said opening her arms with her spoon in one hand and her mug in the other as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world as she grew her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blest by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares her grandfather often called her beth and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion as if trying to atone for some past mistake which no eye but her own could see demi like a true yankee was of an inquiring turn wanting to know everything and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual what for he also possessed a philosophic bent to the great delight of his grandfather who used to hold socratic conversations with him in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk illustration what makes my legs go dranpa what makes my legs go dranpa asked the young philosopher surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air while resting after a gotobed frolic one night its your little mind demi replied the sage stroking the yellow head respectfully what is a little mine it is something which makes your body move as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when i showed it to you open me i want to see it go wound i cant do that any more than you could open the watch god winds you up and you go till he stops you does i and demis brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought is i wounded up like the watch yes but i cant show you how for it is done when we dont see demi felt of his back as if expecting to find it like that of the watch and then gravely remarked i dess dod does it when is asleep a careful explanation followed to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said my dear do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby hes getting great bumps over his eyes and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions if he is old enough to ask the questions he is old enough to receive true answers i am not putting the thoughts into his head but helping him unfold those already there these children are wiser than we are and i have no doubt the boy understands every word i have said to him now demi tell me where you keep your mind if the boy had replied like alcibiades by the gods socrates i cannot tell his grandfather would not have been surprised but when after standing a moment on one leg like a meditative young stork he answered in a tone of calm conviction in my little belly the old gentleman could only join in grandmas laugh and dismiss the class in metaphysics there might have been cause for maternal anxiety if demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy as well as a budding philosopher for often after a discussion which caused hannah to prophesy with ominous nods that child aint long for this world he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear dirty naughty little rascals distract and delight their parents souls meg made many moral rules and tried to keep them but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles the ingenious evasions or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished artful dodgers no more raisins demi theyll make you sick says mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plumpudding day me likes to be sick i dont want to have you so run away and help daisy make pattycakes he reluctantly departs but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit and by and by when an opportunity comes to redress them he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain now you have been good children and ill play anything you like says meg as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot truly marmar asks demi with a brilliant idea in his wellpowdered head yes truly anything you say replies the shortsighted parent preparing herself to sing the three little kittens half a dozen times over or to take her family to buy a penny bun regardless of wind or limb but demi corners her by the cool reply then well go and eat up all the raisins aunt dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children and the trio turned the little house topsyturvy aunt amy was as yet only a name to them aunt beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory but aunt dodo was a living reality and they made the most of her for which compliment she was deeply grateful but when mr bhaer came jo neglected her playfellows and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls daisy who was fond of going about peddling kisses lost her best customer and became bankrupt demi with infantile penetration soon discovered that dodo liked to play with the bearman better than she did with him but though hurt he concealed his anguish for he hadnt the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolatedrops in his waistcoatpocket and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes but demi didnt see it in that light and continued to patronize the bearman with pensive affability while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call and considered his shoulder her throne his arm her refuge his gifts treasures of surpassing worth gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them and does not deceive anybody a particle mr bhaers devotion was sincere however likewise effectivefor honesty is the best policy in love as in law he was one of the men who are at home with children and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one his business whatever it was detained him from day to day but evening seldom failed to bring him out to seewell he always asked for mr march so i suppose he was the attraction the excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was and revelled in long discussions with the kindred spirit till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him mr bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study astonished by the spectacle that met his eye prone upon the floor lay mr march with his respectable legs in the air and beside him likewise prone was demi trying to imitate the attitude with his own short scarletstockinged legs both grovellers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators till mr bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh and jo cried out with a scandalized face father father heres the professor down went the black legs and up came the gray head as the preceptor said with undisturbed dignity good evening mr bhaer excuse me for a moment we are just finishing our lesson now demi make the letter and tell its name i knows him and after a few convulsive efforts the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted its a we dranpa its a we illustration dranpa its a we hes a born weller laughed jo as her parent gathered himself up and her nephew tried to stand on his head as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over what have you been at today bbchen asked mr bhaer picking up the gymnast me went to see little mary and what did you there i kissed her began demi with artless frankness prut thou beginnest early what did the little mary say to that asked mr bhaer continuing to confess the young sinner who stood upon his knee exploring the waistcoatpocket oh she liked it and she kissed me and i liked it dont little boys like little girls added demi with his mouth full and an air of bland satisfaction you precocious chick who put that into your head said jo enjoying the innocent revelations as much as the professor tisnt in mine head its in mine mouf answered literal demi putting out his tongue with a chocolatedrop on it thinking she alluded to confectionery not ideas thou shouldst save some for the little friend sweets to the sweet mannling and mr bhaer offered jo some with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods demi also saw the smile was impressed by it and artlessly inquired do great boys like great girls too fessor like young washington mr bhaer couldnt tell a lie so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes in a tone that made mr march put down his clothesbrush glance at jos retiring face and then sink into his chair looking as if the precocious chick had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour why dodo when she caught him in the chinacloset half an hour afterward nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace instead of shaking him for being there and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly remained one of the problems over which demi puzzled his small wits and was forced to leave unsolved forever illustration tailpiece illustration mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades xlvi under the umbrella while laurie and amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets as they set their house in order and planned a blissful future mr bhaer and jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort along muddy roads and sodden fields i always do take a walk toward evening and i dont know why i should give it up just because i often happen to meet the professor on his way out said jo to herself after two or three encounters for though there were two paths to megs whichever one she took she was sure to meet him either going or returning he was always walking rapidly and never seemed to see her till quite close when he would look as if his shortsighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment then if she was going to megs he always had something for the babies if her face was turned homeward he had merely strolled down to see the river and was just about returning unless they were tired of his frequent calls under the circumstances what could jo do but greet him civilly and invite him in if she was tired of his visits she concealed her weariness with perfect skill and took care that there should be coffee for supper as friedrichi mean mr bhaerdoesnt like tea by the second week every one knew perfectly well what was going on yet every one tried to look as if they were stoneblind to the changes in jos face they never asked why she sang about her work did up her hair three times a day and got so blooming with her evening exercise and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that professor bhaer while talking philosophy with the father was giving the daughter lessons in love jo couldnt even lose her heart in a decorous manner but sternly tried to quench her feelings and failing to do so led a somewhat agitated life she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering after her many and vehement declarations of independence laurie was her especial dread but thanks to the new manager he behaved with praiseworthy propriety never called mr bhaer a capital old fellow in public never alluded in the remotest manner to jos improved appearance or expressed the least surprise at seeing the professors hat on the marches halltable nearly every evening but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coatofarms for a fortnight the professor came and went with loverlike regularity then he stayed away for three whole days and made no signa proceeding which caused everybody to look sober and jo to become pensive at first and thenalas for romancevery cross disgusted i dare say and gone home as suddenly as he came its nothing to me of course but i should think he would have come and bid us goodby like a gentleman she said to herself with a despairing look at the gate as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon youd better take the little umbrella dear it looks like rain said her mother observing that she had on her new bonnet but not alluding to the fact yes marmee do you want anything in town ive got to run in and get some paper returned jo pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother yes i want some twilled silesia a paper of number nine needles and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon have you got your thick boots on and something warm under your cloak i believe so answered jo absently if you happen to meet mr bhaer bring him home to tea i quite long to see the dear man added mrs march jo heard that but made no answer except to kiss her mother and walk rapidly away thinking with a glow of gratitude in spite of her heartache how good she is to me what do girls do who havent any mothers to help them through their troubles the drygoods stores were not down among the countinghouses banks and wholesale warerooms where gentlemen most do congregate but jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand loitering along as if waiting for some one examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another with most unfeminine interest tumbling over barrels being halfsmothered by descending bales and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered how the deuce she got there a drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons for the drops continued to fall and being a woman as well as a lover she felt that though it was too late to save her heart she might her bonnet now she remembered the little umbrella which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off but regret was unavailing and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching she looked up at the lowering sky down at the crimson bow already flecked with black forward along the muddy street then one long lingering look behind at a certain grimy warehouse with hoffmann swartz co over the door and said to herself with a sternly reproachful air it serves me right what business had i to put on all my best things and come philandering down here hoping to see the professor jo im ashamed of you no you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella or find out where he is from his friends you shall trudge away and do your errands in the rain and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet its no more than you deserve now then with that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman who said i beg pardon maam and looked mortally offended somewhat daunted jo righted herself spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons and putting temptation behind her hurried on with increasing dampness about the ankles and much clashing of umbrellas overhead the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention and looking up she saw mr bhaer looking down illustration looking up she saw mr bhaer i feel to know the strongminded lady who goes so bravely under many horsenoses and so fast through much mud what do you down here my friend im shopping mr bhaer smiled as he glanced from the picklefactory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other but he only said politely you haf no umbrella may i go also and take for you the bundles yes thank you jos cheeks were as red as her ribbon and she wondered what he thought of her but she didnt care for in a minute she found herself walking away arminarm with her professor feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy that the world was all right again and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day we thought you had gone said jo hastily for she knew he was looking at her her bonnet wasnt big enough to hide her face and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly did you believe that i should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion and answered heartily no i didnt i knew you were busy about your own affairs but we rather missed youfather and mother especially and you im always glad to see you sir in her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm jo made it rather cool and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor for his smile vanished as he said gravely i thank you and come one time more before i go you are going then i haf no longer any business here it is done successfully i hope said jo for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his i ought to think so for i haf a way opened to me by which i can make my bread and gif my jnglings much help tell me please i like to know all about thethe boys said jo eagerly that is so kind i gladly tell you my friends find for me a place in a college where i teach as at home and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil for this i should be grateful should i not indeed you should how splendid it will be to have you doing what you like and be able to see you often and the boys cried jo clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying ah but we shall not meet often i fear this place is at the west so far away and jo left her skirts to their fate as if it didnt matter now what became of her clothes or herself mr bhaer could read several languages but he had not learned to read women yet he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well and was therefore much amazed by the contradictions of voice face and manner which she showed him in rapid succession that day for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour when she met him she looked surprised though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose when he offered her his arm she took it with a look that filled him with delight but when he asked if she missed him she gave such a chilly formal reply that despair fell upon him on learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands was the joy all for the boys then on hearing his destination she said so far away in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing like one entirely absorbed in the matter heres the place for my errands will you come in it wont take long jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and despatch with which she would accomplish the business but owing to the flutter she was in everything went amiss she upset the tray of needles forgot the silesia was to be twilled till it was cut off gave the wrong change and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter mr bhaer stood by watching her blush and blunder and as he watched his own bewilderment seemed to subside for he was beginning to see that on some occasions women like dreams go by contraries when they came out he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole should we not do a little what you call shopping for the babies and haf a farewell feast tonight if i go for my last call at your so pleasant home he asked stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers what will we buy said jo ignoring the latter part of his speech and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in may they haf oranges and figs asked mr bhaer with a paternal air they eat them when they can get them do you care for nuts like a squirrel hamburg grapes yes we shall surely drink to the fatherland in those jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance and asked why he didnt buy a frail of dates a cask of raisins and a bag of almonds and done with it whereat mr bhaer confiscated her purse produced his own and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes a pot of rosy daisies and a pretty jar of honey to be regarded in the light of a demijohn then distorting his pockets with the knobby bundles and giving her the flowers to hold he put up the old umbrella and they travelled on again miss marsch i haf a great favor to ask of you began the professor after a moist promenade of half a block yes sir and jos heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it i am bold to say it in spite of the rain because so short a time remains to me yes sir and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it i wish to get a little dress for my tina and i am too stupid to go alone will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help yes sir and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator perhaps also a shawl for tinas mother she is so poor and sick and the husband is such a care yes yes a thick warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother ill do it with pleasure mr bhaer im going very fast and hes getting dearer every minute added jo to herself then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy which was pleasant to behold mr bhaer left it all to her so she chose a pretty gown for tina and then ordered out the shawls the clerk being a married man condescended to take an interest in the couple who appeared to be shopping for their family your lady may prefer this its a superior article a most desirable color quite chaste and genteel he said shaking out a comfortable gray shawl and throwing it over jos shoulders illustration does this suit you mr bhaer does this suit you mr bhaer she asked turning her back to him and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face excellently well we will haf it answered the professor smiling to himself as he paid for it while jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargainhunter now shall we go home he asked as if the words were very pleasant to him yes its late and im so tired jos voice was more pathetic than she knew for now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out the world grew muddy and miserable again and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold her head ached and that her heart was colder than the former fuller of pain than the latter mr bhaer was going away he only cared for her as a friend it was all a mistake and the sooner it was over the better with this idea in her head she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged this is not our omniboos said the professor waving the loaded vehicle away and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers i beg your pardon i didnt see the name distinctly never mind i can walk im used to plodding in the mud returned jo winking hard because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes mr bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks though she turned her head away the sight seemed to touch him very much for suddenly stooping down he asked in a tone that meant a great deal hearts dearest why do you cry now if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasnt crying had a cold in her head or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion instead of which that undignified creature answered with an irrepressible sob because you are going away ach mein gott that is so good cried mr bhaer managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles jo i haf nothing but much love to gif you i came to see if you could care for it and i waited to be sure that i was something more than a friend am i can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz he added all in one breath oh yes said jo and he was quite satisfied for she folded both hands over his arm and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella if he carried it it was certainly proposing under difficulties for even if he had desired to do so mr bhaer could not go down upon his knees on account of the mud neither could he offer jo his hand except figuratively for both were full much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in the open street though he was near it so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard if he had not loved jo very much i dont think he could have done it then for she looked far from lovely with her skirts in a deplorable state her rubber boots splashed to the ankle and her bonnet a ruin fortunately mr bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living and she found him more jovelike than ever though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders for he held the umbrella all over jo and every finger of his gloves needed mending passersby probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics for they entirely forgot to hail a bus and strolled leisurely along oblivious of deepening dusk and fog little they cared what anybody thought for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life the magical moment which bestows youth on the old beauty on the plain wealth on the poor and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven the professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss while jo trudged beside him feeling as if her place had always been there and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot of course she was the first to speakintelligibly i mean for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous oh yes were not of a coherent or reportable character friedrich why didnt you ah heaven she gifs me the name that no one speaks since minna died cried the professor pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight i always call you so to myselfi forgot but i wont unless you like it like it it is more sweet to me than i can tell say thou also and i shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine isnt thou a little sentimental asked jo privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable sentimental yes thank gott we germans believe in sentiment and keep ourselves young mit it your english you is so cold say thou hearts dearest it means so much to me pleaded mr bhaer more like a romantic student than a grave professor well then why didnt thou tell me all this sooner asked jo bashfully now i shall haf to show thee all my heart and i so gladly will because thou must take care of it hereafter see then my joah the dear funny little namei had a wish to tell something the day i said goodby in new york but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee and so i spoke not wouldst thou have said yes then if i had spoken i dont know im afraid not for i didnt have any heart just then prut that i do not believe it was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood and waked it up ah well die erste liebe ist die beste but that i should not expect yes the first love is the best so be contented for i never had another teddy was only a boy and soon got over his little fancy said jo anxious to correct the professors mistake good then i shall rest happy and be sure that thou givest me all i haf waited so long i am grown selfish as thou wilt find professorin i like that cried jo delighted with her new name now tell me what brought you at last just when i most wanted you this and mr bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoatpocket jo unfolded it and looked much abashed for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt how could that bring you she asked wondering what he meant i found it by chance i knew it by the names and the initials and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me read and find him i will see that you go not in the wet jo obeyed and hastily skimmed through the lines which she had christened in the garret four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time all fashioned and filled long ago by children now in their prime four little keys hung side by side with faded ribbons brave and gay when fastened there with childish pride long ago on a rainy day four little names one on each lid carved out by a boyish hand and underneath there lieth hid histories of the happy band once playing here and pausing oft to hear the sweet refrain that came and went on the roof aloft in the falling summer rain meg on the first lid smooth and fair i look in with loving eyes for folded here with wellknown care a goodly gathering lies the record of a peaceful life gifts to gentle child and girl a bridal gown lines to a wife a tiny shoe a baby curl no toys in this first chest remain for all are carried away in their old age to join again in another small megs play ah happy mother well i know you hear like a sweet refrain lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain jo on the next lid scratched and worn and within a motley store of headless dolls of schoolbooks torn birds and beasts that speak no more spoils brought home from the fairy ground only trod by youthful feet dreams of a future never found memories of a past still sweet halfwrit poems stories wild april letters warm and cold diaries of a wilful child hints of a woman early old a woman in a lonely home hearing like a sad refrain be worthy love and love will come in the falling summer rain my beth the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name as if by loving eyes that wept by careful hands that often came death canonized for us one saint ever less human than divine and still we lay with tender plaint relics in this household shrine the silver bell so seldom rung the little cap which last she wore the fair dead catherine that hung by angels borne above her door the songs she sang without lament in her prisonhouse of pain forever are they sweetly blent with the falling summer rain upon the last lids polished field legend now both fair and true a gallant knight bears on his shield amy in letters gold and blue within lie snoods that bound her hair slippers that have danced their last faded flowers laid by with care fans whose airy toils are past gay valentines all ardent flames trifles that have borne their part in girlish hopes and fears and shames the record of a maiden heart now learning fairer truer spells hearing like a blithe refrain the silver sound of bridal bells in the falling summer rain four little chests all in a row dim with dust and worn by time four women taught by weal and woe to love and labor in their prime four sisters parted for an hour none lost one only gone before made by loves immortal power nearest and dearest evermore oh when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the fathers sight may they be rich in golden hours deeds that show fairer for the light lives whose brave music long shall ring like a spiritstirring strain souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain j m its very bad poetry but i felt it when i wrote it one day when i was very lonely and had a good cry on a ragbag i never thought it would go where it could tell tales said jo tearing up the verses the professor had treasured so long let it go it has done its duty and i will haf a fresh one when i read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets said mr bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind yes he added earnestly i read that and i think to myself she has a sorrow she is lonely she would find comfort in true love i haf a heart full full for her shall i not go and say if this is not too poor a thing to gif for what i shall hope to receive take it in gotts name and so you came to find that it was not too poor but the one precious thing i needed whispered jo i had no courage to think that at first heavenly kind as was your welcome to me but soon i began to hope and then i said i will haf her if i die for it and so i will cried mr bhaer with a defiant nod as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down jo thought that was splendid and resolved to be worthy of her knight though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array what made you stay away so long she asked presently finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent it was not easy but i could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until i could haf a prospect of one to give you after much time perhaps and hard work how could i ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow who has no fortune but a little learning im glad you are poor i couldnt bear a rich husband said jo decidedly adding in a softer tone dont fear poverty ive known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those i love and dont call yourself oldforty is the prime of life i couldnt help loving you if you were seventy the professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief if he could have got at it as he couldnt jo wiped his eyes for him and said laughing as she took away a bundle or two i may be strongminded but no one can say im out of my sphere now for womans special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens im to carry my share friedrich and help to earn the home make up your mind to that or ill never go she added resolutely as he tried to reclaim his load we shall see haf you patience to wait a long time jo i must go away and do my work alone i must help my boys first because even for you i may not break my word to minna can you forgif that and be happy while we hope and wait yes i know i can for we love one another and that makes all the rest easy to bear i have my duty also and my work i couldnt enjoy myself if i neglected them even for you so theres no need of hurry or impatience you can do your part out west i can do mine here and both be happy hoping for the best and leaving the future to be as god wills ah thou gifest me such hope and courage and i haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands cried the professor quite overcome illustration under the umbrella jo never never would learn to be proper for when he said that as they stood upon the steps she just put both hands into his whispering tenderly not empty now and stooping down kissed her friedrich under the umbrella it was dreadful but she would have done it if the flock of draggletailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings for she was very far gone indeed and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness though it came in such a very simple guise that was the crowning moment of both their lives when turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them with a glad welcome home jo led her lover in and shut the door illustration tailpiece illustration harvest time xlvii harvest time for a year jo and her professor worked and waited hoped and loved met occasionally and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for laurie said the second year began rather soberly for their prospects did not brighten and aunt march died suddenly but when their first sorrow was overfor they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tonguethey found they had cause for rejoicing for she had left plumfield to jo which made all sorts of joyful things possible its a fine old place and will bring a handsome sum for of course you intend to sell it said laurie as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later no i dont was jos decided answer as she petted the fat poodle whom she had adopted out of respect to his former mistress you dont mean to live there yes i do but my dear girl its an immense house and will take a power of money to keep it in order the garden and orchard alone need two or three men and farming isnt in bhaers line i take it hell try his hand at it there if i propose it and you expect to live on the produce of the place well that sounds paradisiacal but youll find it desperate hard work the crop we are going to raise is a profitable one and jo laughed of what is this fine crop to consist maam boys i want to open a school for little ladsa good happy homelike school with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them theres a truly joian plan for you isnt that just like her cried laurie appealing to the family who looked as much surprised as he i like it said mrs march decidedly so do i added her husband who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the socratic method of education on modern youth it will be an immense care for jo said meg stroking the head of her one allabsorbing son jo can do it and be happy in it its a splendid idea tell us all about it cried mr laurence who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand but knew that they would refuse his help i knew youd stand by me sir amy does tooi see it in her eyes though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks now my dear people continued jo earnestly just understand that this isnt a new idea of mine but a longcherished plan before my fritz came i used to think how when id made my fortune and no one needed me at home id hire a big house and pick up some poor forlorn little lads who hadnt any mothers and take care of them and make life jolly for them before it was too late i see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute i love so to do anything for them i seem to feel their wants and sympathize with their troubles and oh i should so like to be a mother to them mrs march held out her hand to jo who took it smiling with tears in her eyes and went on in the old enthusiastic way which they had not seen for a long while i told my plan to fritz once and he said it was just what he would like and agreed to try it when we got rich bless his dear heart hes been doing it all his lifehelping poor boys i mean not getting rich that hell never be money doesnt stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any but now thanks to my good old aunt who loved me better than i ever deserved im rich at least i feel so and we can live at plumfield perfectly well if we have a flourishing school its just the place for boys the house is big and the furniture strong and plain theres plenty of room for dozens inside and splendid grounds outside they could help in the garden and orchard such work is healthy isnt it sir then fritz can train and teach in his own way and father will help him i can feed and nurse and pet and scold them and mother will be my standby ive always longed for lots of boys and never had enough now i can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my hearts content think what luxuryplumfield my own and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture the family went off into a gale of merriment and mr laurence laughed till they thought hed have an apoplectic fit i dont see anything funny she said gravely when she could be heard nothing could be more natural or proper than for my professor to open a school and for me to prefer to reside on my own estate she is putting on airs already said laurie who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke but may i inquire how you intend to support the establishment if all the pupils are little ragamuffins im afraid your crop wont be profitable in a worldly sense mrs bhaer now dont be a wetblanket teddy of course i shall have rich pupils alsoperhaps begin with such altogether then when ive got a start i can take a ragamuffin or two just for a relish rich peoples children often need care and comfort as well as poor ive seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants or backward ones pushed forward when its real cruelty some are naughty through mismanagement or neglect and some lose their mothers besides the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age and thats the very time they need most patience and kindness people laugh at them and hustle them about try to keep them out of sight and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men they dont complain muchplucky little soulsbut they feel it ive been through something of it and i know all about it ive a special interest in such young bears and like to show them that i see the warm honest wellmeaning boys hearts in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsyturvy heads ive had experience too for havent i brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family ill testify that you tried to do it said laurie with a grateful look and ive succeeded beyond my hopes for here you are a steady sensible business man doing heaps of good with your money and laying up the blessings of the poor instead of dollars but you are not merely a business man you love good and beautiful things enjoy them yourself and let others go halves as you always did in the old times i am proud of you teddy for you get better every year and every one feels it though you wont let them say so yes and when i have my flock ill just point to you and say theres your model my lads poor laurie didnt know where to look for man though he was something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him i say jo thats rather too much he began just in his old boyish way you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for except by doing my best not to disappoint you you have rather cast me off lately jo but ive had the best of help nevertheless so if ive got on at all you may thank these two for it and he laid one hand gently on his grandfathers white head the other on amys golden one for the three were never far apart i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world burst out jo who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then when i have one of my own i hope it will be as happy as the three i know and love the best if john and my fritz were only here it would be quite a little heaven on earth she added more quietly and that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels hopes and plans her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own and thinking tender thoughts of beth it was a very astonishing year altogether for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner almost before she knew where she was jo found herself married and settled at plumfield then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms and flourished surprisingly poor boys as well as rich for mr laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution and begging the bhaers to take pity on the child and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support in this way the sly old gentleman got round proud jo and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted of course it was uphill work at first and jo made queer mistakes but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end how jo did enjoy her wilderness of boys and how poor dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim wellordered plumfield overrun with toms dicks and harrys there was a sort of poetic justice about it after all for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles round and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved and played cricket in the big field where the irritable cow with a crumpled horn used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed it became a sort of boys paradise and laurie suggested that it should be called the bhaergarten as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants it never was a fashionable school and the professor did not lay up a fortune but it was just what jo intended it to bea happy homelike place for boys who needed teaching care and kindness every room in the big house was soon full every little plot in the garden soon had its owner a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed for pet animals were allowed and three times a day jo smiled at her fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces which all turned to her with affectionate eyes confiding words and grateful hearts full of love for mother bhaer she had boys enough now and did not tire of them though they were not angels by any means and some of them caused both professor and professorin much trouble and anxiety but her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest sauciest most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience skill and in time success for no mortal boy could hold out long with father bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun and mother bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven very precious to jo was the friendship of the lads their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing their droll or touching little confidences their pleasant enthusiasms hopes and plans even their misfortunes for they only endeared them to her all the more there were slow boys and bashful boys feeble boys and riotous boys boys that lisped and boys that stuttered one or two lame ones and a merry little quadroon who could not be taken in elsewhere but who was welcome to the bhaergarten though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school yes jo was a very happy woman there in spite of hard work much anxiety and a perpetual racket she enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers as the years went on two little lads of her own came to increase her happinessrob named for grandpa and teddy a happygolucky baby who seemed to have inherited his papas sunshiny temper as well as his mothers lively spirit how they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts but they flourished like dandelions in spring and their rough nurses loved and served them well there were a great many holidays at plumfield and one of the most delightful was the yearly applepicking for then the marches laurences brookes and bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it five years after jos wedding one of these fruitful festivals occurreda mellow october day when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins the old orchard wore its holiday attire goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast squirrels were busy with their small harvesting birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake everybody was there everybody laughed and sang climbed up and tumbled down everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it and every one gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world mr march strolled placidly about quoting tusser cowley and columella to mr laurence while enjoying the gentle apples winey juice the professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout teutonic knight with a pole for a lance leading on the boys who made a hook and ladder company of themselves and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling laurie devoted himself to the little ones rode his small daughter in a bushelbasket took daisy up among the birds nests and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck mrs march and meg sat among the apple piles like a pair of pomonas sorting the contributions that kept pouring in while amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups and watched over one pale lad who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him jo was in her element that day and rushed about with her gown pinned up her hat anywhere but on her head and her baby tucked under her arm ready for any lively adventure which might turn up little teddy bore a charmed life for nothing ever happened to him and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad galloped off on the back of another or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything from pickled cabbage to buttons nails and their own small shoes she knew that little ted would turn up again in time safe and rosy dirty and serene and she always received him back with a hearty welcome for jo loved her babies tenderly illustration teddy bore a charmed life at four oclock a lull took place and baskets remained empty while the applepickers rested and compared rents and bruises then jo and meg with a detachment of the bigger boys set forth the supper on the grass for an outofdoor tea was always the crowning joy of the day the land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions for the lads were not required to sit at table but allowed to partake of refreshment as they likedfreedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game cookies were sown broadcast over the field and appleturnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird the little girls had a private teaparty and ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will when no one could eat any more the professor proposed the first regular toast which was always drunk at such timesaunt march god bless her a toast heartily given by the good man who never forgot how much he owed her and quietly drunk by the boys who had been taught to keep her memory green now grandmas sixtieth birthday long life to her with three times three that was given with a will as you may well believe and the cheering once begun it was hard to stop it everybodys health was proposed from mr laurence who was considered their special patron to the astonished guineapig who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master demi as the oldest grandchild then presented the queen of the day with various gifts so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow funny presents some of them but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to grandmasfor the childrens gifts were all their own every stitch daisys patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to mrs march demis shoebox was a miracle of mechanical skill though the cover wouldnt shut robs footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was very soothing and no page of the costly book amys child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals the wordsto dear grandma from her little beth during this ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared and when mrs march had tried to thank her children and broken down while teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore the professor suddenly began to sing then from above him voice after voice took up the words and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir as the boys sung with all their hearts the little song jo had written laurie set to music and the professor trained his lads to give with the best effect this was something altogether new and it proved a grand success for mrs march couldnt get over her surprise and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds from tall franz and emil to the little quadroon who had the sweetest voice of all after this the boys dispersed for a final lark leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival tree illustration leaving mrs march and her daughters under the festival treepage 583 i dont think i ever ought to call myself unlucky jo again when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified said mrs bhaer taking teddys little fist out of the milkpitcher in which he was rapturously churning and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago do you remember our castles in the air asked amy smiling as she watched laurie and john playing cricket with the boys dear fellows it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day answered jo who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind yes i remember but the life i wanted then seems selfish lonely and cold to me now i havent given up the hope that i may write a good book yet but i can wait and im sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these and jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father leaning on the professors arm as they walked to and fro in the sunshine deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much and then to her mother sitting enthroned among her daughters with their children in her lap and at her feet as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them my castle was the most nearly realized of all i asked for splendid things to be sure but in my heart i knew i should be satisfied if i had a little home and john and some dear children like these ive got them all thank god and am the happiest woman in the world and meg laid her hand on her tall boys head with a face full of tender and devout content my castle is very different from what i planned but i would not alter it though like jo i dont relinquish all my artistic hopes or confine myself to helping others fulfil their dreams of beauty ive begun to model a figure of baby and laurie says it is the best thing ive ever done i think so myself and mean to do it in marble so that whatever happens i may at least keep the image of my little angel as amy spoke a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms for her one wellbeloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over amys sunshine this cross was doing much for both father and mother for one love and sorrow bound them closely together amys nature was growing sweeter deeper and more tender laurie was growing more serious strong and firm and both were learning that beauty youth good fortune even love itself cannot keep care and pain loss and sorrow from the most blest for into each life some rain must fall some days must be dark and sad and dreary she is growing better i am sure of it my dear dont despond but hope and keep happy said mrs march as tenderhearted daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousins pale one i never ought to while i have you to cheer me up marmee and laurie to take more than half of every burden replied amy warmly he never lets me see his anxiety but is so sweet and patient with me so devoted to beth and such a stay and comfort to me always that i cant love him enough so in spite of my one cross i can say with meg thank god im a happy woman theres no need for me to say it for every one can see that im far happier than i deserve added jo glancing from her good husband to her chubby children tumbling on the grass beside her fritz is getting gray and stout im growing as thin as a shadow and am thirty we never shall be rich and plumfield may burn up any night for that incorrigible tommy bangs will smoke sweetfern cigars under the bedclothes though hes set himself afire three times already but in spite of these unromantic facts i have nothing to complain of and never was so jolly in my life excuse the remark but living among boys i cant help using their expressions now and then yes jo i think your harvest will be a good one began mrs march frightening away a big black cricket that was staring teddy out of countenance not half so good as yours mother here it is and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done cried jo with the loving impetuosity which she never could outgrow i hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year said amy softly a large sheaf but i know theres room in your heart for it marmee dear added megs tender voice touched to the heart mrs march could only stretch out her arms as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself and say with face and voice full of motherly love gratitude and humility o my girls however long you may live i never can wish you a greater happiness than this illustration tailpiece

bounce high bounce for her too till she cry lover goldhatted highbouncing lover i must have you thomas parke dinvilliers i in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that ive been turning over in my mind ever since whenever you feel like criticizing anyone he told me just remember that all the people in this world havent had the advantages that youve had he didnt say any more but weve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that in consequence im inclined to reserve all judgements a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild unknown men most of the confidences were unsoughtfrequently i have feigned sleep preoccupation or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that as my father snobbishly suggested and i snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth and after boasting this way of my tolerance i come to the admission that it has a limit conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point i dont care what its founded on when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart only gatsby the man who gives his name to this book was exempt from my reactiongatsby who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures then there was something gorgeous about him some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the creative temperamentit was an extraordinary gift for hope a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again nogatsby turned out all right at the end it is what preyed on gatsby what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and shortwinded elations of men my family have been prominent welltodo people in this middle western city for three generations the carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that were descended from the dukes of buccleuch but the actual founder of my line was my grandfathers brother who came here in fiftyone sent a substitute to the civil war and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today i never saw this greatuncle but im supposed to look like himwith special reference to the rather hardboiled painting that hangs in fathers office i graduated from new haven in 1915 just a quarter of a century after my father and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war i enjoyed the counterraid so thoroughly that i came back restless instead of being the warm centre of the world the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universeso i decided to go east and learn the bond business everybody i knew was in the bond business so i supposed it could support one more single man all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me and finally said whyyees with very grave hesitant faces father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays i came east permanently i thought in the spring of twentytwo the practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea he found the house a weatherbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington and i went out to the country alone i had a dogat least i had him for a few days until he ran awayand an old dodge and a finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man more recently arrived than i stopped me on the road how do you get to west egg village he asked helplessly i told him and as i walked on i was lonely no longer i was a guide a pathfinder an original settler he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer there was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breathgiving air i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides i was rather literary in collegeone year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the yale newsand now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists the wellrounded man this isnt just an epigramlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window after all it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new yorkand where there are among other natural curiosities two unusual formations of land twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere the great wet barnyard of long island sound they are not perfect ovalslike the egg in the columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact endbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead to the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size i lived at west egg thewell the less fashionable of the two though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them my house was at the very tip of the egg only fifty yards from the sound and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standardit was a factual imitation of some htel de ville in normandy with a tower on one side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden it was gatsbys mansion or rather as i didnt know mr gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name my own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so i had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbours lawn and the consoling proximity of millionairesall for eighty dollars a month across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans daisy was my second cousin once removed and id known tom in college and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago her husband among various physical accomplishments had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new havena national figure in a way one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twentyone that everything afterward savours of anticlimax his family were enormously wealthyeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproachbut now hed left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away for instance hed brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that why they came east i dont know they had spent a year in france for no particular reason and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together this was a permanent move said daisy over the telephone but i didnt believe iti had no sight into daisys heart but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all their house was even more elaborate than i expected a cheerful redandwhite georgian colonial mansion overlooking the bay the lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardensfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run the front was broken by a line of french windows glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch he had changed since his new haven years now he was a sturdy strawhaired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that bodyhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat it was a body capable of enormous leveragea cruel body his speaking voice a gruff husky tenor added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed there was a touch of paternal contempt in it even toward people he likedand there were men at new haven who had hated his guts now dont think my opinion on these matters is final he seemed to say just because im stronger and more of a man than you are we were in the same senior society and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh defiant wistfulness of his own we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch ive got a nice place here he said his eyes flashing about restlessly turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunken italian garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snubnosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore it belonged to demaine the oil man he turned me around again politely and abruptly well go inside we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosycoloured space fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house a breeze blew through the room blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags twisting them up toward the frosted weddingcake of the ceiling and then rippled over the winecoloured rug making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor the younger of the two was a stranger to me she was extended full length at her end of the divan completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of itindeed i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in the other girl daisy made an attempt to riseshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expressionthen she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and i laughed too and came forward into the room im pparalysed with happiness she laughed again as if she said something very witty and held my hand for a moment looking up into my face promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see that was a way she had she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker ive heard it said that daisys murmur was only to make people lean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming at any rate miss bakers lips fluttered she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back againthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright again a sort of apology arose to my lips almost any exhibition of complete selfsufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me i looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low thrilling voice it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget a singing compulsion a whispered listen a promise that she had done gay exciting things just a while since and that there were gay exciting things hovering in the next hour i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me do they miss me she cried ecstatically the whole town is desolate all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and theres a persistent wail all night along the north shore how gorgeous lets go back tom tomorrow then she added irrelevantly you ought to see the baby id like to shes asleep shes three years old havent you ever seen her never well you ought to see her shes tom buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder what you doing nick im a bond man who with i told him never heard of them he remarked decisively this annoyed me you will i answered shortly you will if you stay in the east oh ill stay in the east dont you worry he said glancing at daisy and then back at me as if he were alert for something more id be a god damned fool to live anywhere else at this point miss baker said absolutely with such suddenness that i startedit was the first word she had uttered since i came into the room evidently it surprised her as much as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapid deft movements stood up into the room im stiff she complained ive been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember dont look at me daisy retorted ive been trying to get you to new york all afternoon no thanks said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry im absolutely in training her host looked at her incredulously you are he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass how you ever get anything done is beyond me i looked at miss baker wondering what it was she got done i enjoyed looking at her she was a slender smallbreasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet her grey sunstrained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discontented face it occurred to me now that i had seen her or a picture of her somewhere before you live in west egg she remarked contemptuously i know somebody there i dont know a single you must know gatsby gatsby demanded daisy what gatsby before i could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square slenderly languidly their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out on to a rosycoloured porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind why candles objected daisy frowning she snapped them out with her fingers in two weeks itll be the longest day in the year she looked at us all radiantly do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it we ought to plan something yawned miss baker sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed all right said daisy whatll we plan she turned to me helplessly what do people plan before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger look she complained i hurt it we all lookedthe knuckle was black and blue you did it tom she said accusingly i know you didnt mean to but you did do it thats what i get for marrying a brute of a man a great big hulking physical specimen of a i hate that word hulking objected tom crossly even in kidding hulking insisted daisy sometimes she and miss baker talked at once unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire they were here and they accepted tom and me making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away it was sharply different from the west where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself you make me feel uncivilized daisy i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret cant you talk about crops or something i meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way civilizations going to pieces broke out tom violently ive gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things have you read the rise of the coloured empires by this man goddard why no i answered rather surprised by his tone well its a fine book and everybody ought to read it the idea is if we dont look out the white race will bewill be utterly submerged its all scientific stuff its been proved toms getting very profound said daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness he reads deep books with long words in them what was that word we well these books are all scientific insisted tom glancing at her impatiently this fellow has worked out the whole thing its up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things weve got to beat them down whispered daisy winking ferociously toward the fervent sun you ought to live in california began miss baker but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair this idea is that were nordics i am and you are and you are and after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again and weve produced all the things that go to make civilizationoh science and art and all that do you see there was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency more acute than of old was not enough to him any more when almost immediately the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me ill tell you a family secret she whispered enthusiastically its about the butlers nose do you want to hear about the butlers nose thats why i came over tonight well he wasnt always a butler he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people he had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose things went from bad to worse suggested miss baker yes things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listenedthen the glow faded each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk the butler came back and murmured something close to toms ear whereupon tom frowned pushed back his chair and without a word went inside as if his absence quickened something within her daisy leaned forward again her voice glowing and singing i love to see you at my table nick you remind me of aof a rose an absolute rose doesnt he she turned to miss baker for confirmation an absolute rose this was untrue i am not even faintly like a rose she was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless thrilling words then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said sh in a warning voice a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and miss baker leaned forward unashamed trying to hear the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank down mounted excitedly and then ceased altogether this mr gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour i began dont talk i want to hear what happens is something happening i inquired innocently you mean to say you dont know said miss baker honestly surprised i thought everybody knew i dont why she said hesitantly toms got some woman in new york got some woman i repeated blankly miss baker nodded she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time dont you think almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and tom and daisy were back at the table it couldnt be helped cried daisy with tense gaiety she sat down glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me and continued i looked outdoors for a minute and its very romantic outdoors theres a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line hes singing away her voice sang its romantic isnt it tom very romantic he said and then miserably to me if its light enough after dinner i want to take you down to the stables the telephone rang inside startlingly and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables in fact all subjects vanished into air among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again pointlessly and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone and yet to avoid all eyes i couldnt guess what daisy and tom were thinking but i doubt if even miss baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guests shrill metallic urgency out of mind to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguingmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police the horses needless to say were not mentioned again tom and miss baker with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl we dont know each other very well nick she said suddenly even if we are cousins you didnt come to my wedding i wasnt back from the war thats true she hesitated well ive had a very bad time nick and im pretty cynical about everything evidently she had reason to be i waited but she didnt say any more and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter i suppose she talks andeats and everything oh yes she looked at me absently listen nick let me tell you what i said when she was born would you like to hear very much itll show you how ive gotten to feel aboutthings well she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl she told me it was a girl and so i turned my head away and wept all right i said im glad its a girl and i hope shell be a foolthats the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful little fool you see i think everythings terrible anyhow she went on in a convinced way everybody thinks sothe most advanced people and i know ive been everywhere and seen everything and done everything her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way rather like toms and she laughed with thrilling scorn sophisticatedgod im sophisticated the instant her voice broke off ceasing to compel my attention my belief i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said it made me uneasy as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me i waited and sure enough in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged inside the crimson room bloomed with light tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening postthe words murmurous and uninflected running together in a soothing tune the lamplight bright on his boots and dull on the autumnleaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand to be continued she said tossing the magazine on the table in our very next issue her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee and she stood up ten oclock she remarked apparently finding the time on the ceiling time for this good girl to go to bed jordans going to play in the tournament tomorrow explained daisy over at westchester ohyoure jordan baker i knew now why her face was familiarits pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach i had heard some story of her too a critical unpleasant story but what it was i had forgotten long ago good night she said softly wake me at eight wont you if youll get up i will good night mr carraway see you anon of course you will confirmed daisy in fact i think ill arrange a marriage come over often nick and ill sort ofohfling you together you knowlock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat and all that sort of thing good night called miss baker from the stairs i havent heard a word shes a nice girl said tom after a moment they oughtnt to let her run around the country this way who oughtnt to inquired daisy coldly her family her family is one aunt about a thousand years old besides nicks going to look after her arent you nick shes going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer i think the home influence will be very good for her daisy and tom looked at each other for a moment in silence is she from new york i asked quickly from louisville our white girlhood was passed together there our beautiful white did you give nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda demanded tom suddenly did i she looked at me i cant seem to remember but i think we talked about the nordic race yes im sure we did it sort of crept up on us and first thing you know dont believe everything you hear nick he advised me i said lightly that i had heard nothing at all and a few minutes later i got up to go home they came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light as i started my motor daisy peremptorily called wait i forgot to ask you something and its important we heard you were engaged to a girl out west thats right corroborated tom kindly we heard that you were engaged its a libel im too poor but we heard it insisted daisy surprising me by opening up again in a flowerlike way we heard it from three people so it must be true of course i knew what they were referring to but i wasnt even vaguely engaged the fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons i had come east you cant stop going with an old friend on account of rumours and on the other hand i had no intention of being rumoured into marriage their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely richnevertheless i was confused and a little disgusted as i drove away it seemed to me that the thing for daisy to do was to rush out of the house child in armsbut apparently there were no such intentions in her head as for tom the fact that he had some woman in new york was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages where new red petrolpumps sat out in pools of light and when i reached my estate at west egg i ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard the wind had blown off leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life the silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it i saw that i was not alonefifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbours mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was mr gatsby himself come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens i decided to call to him miss baker had mentioned him at dinner and that would do for an introduction but i didnt call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alonehe stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way and far as i was from him i could have sworn he was trembling involuntarily i glanced seawardand distinguished nothing except a single green light minute and far away that might have been the end of a dock when i looked once more for gatsby he had vanished and i was alone again in the unquiet darkness ii about halfway between west egg and new york the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land this is a valley of ashesa fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcendent effort of ashgrey men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest and immediately the ashgrey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight but above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment the eyes of doctor t j eckleburg the eyes of doctor t j eckleburg are blue and gigantictheir retinas are one yard high they look out of no face but instead from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of queens and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away but his eyes dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain brood on over the solemn dumping ground the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour there is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that i first met tom buchanans mistress the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known his acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafs with her and leaving her at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he knew though i was curious to see her i had no desire to meet herbut i did i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car were getting off he insisted i want you to meet my girl i think hed tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence the supercilious assumption was that on sunday afternoon i had nothing better to do i followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under doctor eckleburgs persistent stare the only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land a sort of compact main street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an allnight restaurant approached by a trail of ashes the third was a garagerepairs george b wilson cars bought and soldand i followed tom inside the interior was unprosperous and bare the only car visible was the dustcovered wreck of a ford which crouched in a dim corner it had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office wiping his hands on a piece of waste he was a blond spiritless man anaemic and faintly handsome when he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes hello wilson old man said tom slapping him jovially on the shoulder hows business i cant complain answered wilson unconvincingly when are you going to sell me that car next week ive got my man working on it now works pretty slow dont he no he doesnt said tom coldly and if you feel that way about it maybe id better sell it somewhere else after all i dont mean that explained wilson quickly i just meant his voice faded off and tom glanced impatiently around the garage then i heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door she was in the middle thirties and faintly stout but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can her face above a spotted dress of dark blue crpedechine contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering she smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with tom looking him flush in the eye then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft coarse voice get some chairs why dont you so somebody can sit down oh sure agreed wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinityexcept his wife who moved close to tom i want to see you said tom intently get on the next train all right ill meet you by the newsstand on the lower level she nodded and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door we waited for her down the road and out of sight it was a few days before the fourth of july and a grey scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track terrible place isnt it said tom exchanging a frown with doctor eckleburg awful it does her good to get away doesnt her husband object wilson he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york hes so dumb he doesnt know hes alive so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new yorkor not quite together for mrs wilson sat discreetly in another car tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might be on the train she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in new york at the newsstand she bought a copy of town tattle and a movingpicture magazine and in the station drugstore some cold cream and a small flask of perfume upstairs in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one lavendercoloured with grey upholstery and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine but immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass i want to get one of those dogs she said earnestly i want to get one for the apartment theyre nice to havea dog we backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john d rockefeller in a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed what kind are they asked mrs wilson eagerly as he came to the taxiwindow all kinds what kind do you want lady id like to get one of those police dogs i dont suppose you got that kind the man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged in his hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of the neck thats no police dog said tom no its not exactly a police dog said the man with disappointment in his voice its more of an airedale he passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back look at that coat some coat thats a dog thatll never bother you with catching cold i think its cute said mrs wilson enthusiastically how much is it that dog he looked at it admiringly that dog will cost you ten dollars the airedaleundoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly whitechanged hands and settled down into mrs wilsons lap where she fondled the weatherproof coat with rapture is it a boy or a girl she asked delicately that dog that dogs a boy its a bitch said tom decisively heres your money go and buy ten more dogs with it we drove over to fifth avenue warm and soft almost pastoral on the summer sunday afternoon i wouldnt have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner hold on i said i have to leave you here no you dont interposed tom quickly myrtlell be hurt if you dont come up to the apartment wont you myrtle come on she urged ill telephone my sister catherine shes said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know well id like to but we went on cutting back again over the park toward the west hundreds at 158th street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartmenthouses throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood mrs wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in im going to have the mckees come up she announced as we rose in the elevator and of course i got to call up my sister too the apartment was on the top floora small livingroom a small diningroom a small bedroom and a bath the livingroom was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of versailles the only picture was an overenlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room several old copies of town tattle lay on the table together with a copy of simon called peter and some of the small scandal magazines of broadway mrs wilson was first concerned with the dog a reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuitsone of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon meanwhile tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked bureau door i have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight oclock the apartment was full of cheerful sun sitting on toms lap mrs wilson called up several people on the telephone then there were no cigarettes and i went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner when i came back they had both disappeared so i sat down discreetly in the livingroom and read a chapter of simon called petereither it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things because it didnt make any sense to me just as tom and myrtle after the first drink mrs wilson and i called each other by our first names reappeared company commenced to arrive at the apartment door the sister catherine was a slender worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face when she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms she came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that i wondered if she lived here but when i asked her she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel mr mckee was a pale feminine man from the flat below he had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room he informed me that he was in the artistic game and i gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of mrs wilsons mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall his wife was shrill languid handsome and horrible she told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twentyseven times since they had been married mrs wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of creamcoloured chiffon which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room with the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change the intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur her laughter her gestures her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creaking pivot through the smoky air my dear she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time all they think of is money i had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill youd of thought she had my appendicitis out what was the name of the woman asked mrs mckee mrs eberhardt she goes around looking at peoples feet in their own homes i like your dress remarked mrs mckee i think its adorable mrs wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain its just a crazy old thing she said i just slip it on sometimes when i dont care what i look like but it looks wonderful on you if you know what i mean pursued mrs mckee if chester could only get you in that pose i think he could make something of it we all looked in silence at mrs wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile mr mckee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face i should change the light he said after a moment id like to bring out the modelling of the features and id try to get hold of all the back hair i wouldnt think of changing the light cried mrs mckee i think its her husband said sh and we all looked at the subject again whereupon tom buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet you mckees have something to drink he said get some more ice and mineral water myrtle before everybody goes to sleep i told that boy about the ice myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders these people you have to keep after them all the time she looked at me and laughed pointlessly then she flounced over to the dog kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there ive done some nice things out on long island asserted mr mckee tom looked at him blankly two of them we have framed downstairs two what demanded tom two studies one of them i call montauk pointthe gulls and the other i call montauk pointthe sea the sister catherine sat down beside me on the couch do you live down on long island too she inquired i live at west egg really i was down there at a party about a month ago at a man named gatsbys do you know him i live next door to him well they say hes a nephew or a cousin of kaiser wilhelms thats where all his money comes from really she nodded im scared of him id hate to have him get anything on me this absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by mrs mckees pointing suddenly at catherine chester i think you could do something with her she broke out but mr mckee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to tom id like to do more work on long island if i could get the entry all i ask is that they should give me a start ask myrtle said tom breaking into a short shout of laughter as mrs wilson entered with a tray shell give you a letter of introduction wont you myrtle do what she asked startled youll give mckee a letter of introduction to your husband so he can do some studies of him his lips moved silently for a moment as he invented george b wilson at the gasoline pump or something like that catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear neither of them can stand the person theyre married to cant they cant stand them she looked at myrtle and then at tom what i say is why go on living with them if they cant stand them if i was them id get a divorce and get married to each other right away doesnt she like wilson either the answer to this was unexpected it came from myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene you see cried catherine triumphantly she lowered her voice again its really his wife thats keeping them apart shes a catholic and they dont believe in divorce daisy was not a catholic and i was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie when they do get married continued catherine theyre going west to live for a while until it blows over itd be more discreet to go to europe oh do you like europe she exclaimed surprisingly i just got back from monte carlo really just last year i went over there with another girl stay long no we just went to monte carlo and back we went by way of marseilles we had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms we had an awful time getting back i can tell you god how i hated that town the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the mediterraneanthen the shrill voice of mrs mckee called me back into the room i almost made a mistake too she declared vigorously i almost married a little kike whod been after me for years i knew he was below me everybody kept saying to me lucille that mans way below you but if i hadnt met chester hed of got me sure yes but listen said myrtle wilson nodding her head up and down at least you didnt marry him i know i didnt well i married him said myrtle ambiguously and thats the difference between your case and mine why did you myrtle demanded catherine nobody forced you to myrtle considered i married him because i thought he was a gentleman she said finally i thought he knew something about breeding but he wasnt fit to lick my shoe you were crazy about him for a while said catherine crazy about him cried myrtle incredulously who said i was crazy about him i never was any more crazy about him than i was about that man there she pointed suddenly at me and everyone looked at me accusingly i tried to show by my expression that i expected no affection the only crazy i was was when i married him i knew right away i made a mistake he borrowed somebodys best suit to get married in and never even told me about it and the man came after it one day when he was out oh is that your suit i said this is the first i ever heard about it but i gave it to him and then i lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon she really ought to get away from him resumed catherine to me theyve been living over that garage for eleven years and toms the first sweetie she ever had the bottle of whiskya second onewas now in constant demand by all present excepting catherine who felt just as good on nothing at all tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches which were a complete supper in themselves i wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time i tried to go i became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back as if with ropes into my chair yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets and i saw him too looking up and wondering i was within and without simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with tom it was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train i was going up to new york to see my sister and spend the night he had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and i couldnt keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me i had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head when we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm and so i told him id have to call a policeman but he knew i lied i was so excited that when i got into a taxi with him i didnt hardly know i wasnt getting into a subway train all i kept thinking about over and over was you cant live forever you cant live forever she turned to mrs mckee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter my dear she cried im going to give you this dress as soon as im through with it ive got to get another one tomorrow im going to make a list of all the things ive got to get a massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring and a wreath with a black silk bow for mothers grave thatll last all summer i got to write down a list so i wont forget all the things i got to do it was nine oclockalmost immediately afterward i looked at my watch and found it was ten mr mckee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap like a photograph of a man of action taking out my handkerchief i wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon the little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly people disappeared reappeared made plans to go somewhere and then lost each other searched for each other found each other a few feet away some time toward midnight tom buchanan and mrs wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether mrs wilson had any right to mention daisys name daisy daisy daisy shouted mrs wilson ill say it whenever i want to daisy dai making a short deft movement tom buchanan broke her nose with his open hand then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor and womens voices scolding and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain mr mckee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door when he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scenehis wife and catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of town tattle over the tapestry scenes of versailles then mr mckee turned and continued on out the door taking my hat from the chandelier i followed come to lunch some day he suggested as we groaned down in the elevator where anywhere keep your hands off the lever snapped the elevator boy i beg your pardon said mr mckee with dignity i didnt know i was touching it all right i agreed ill be glad to i was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets clad in his underwear with a great portfolio in his hands beauty and the beast loneliness old grocery horse brookn bridge then i was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the pennsylvania station staring at the morning tribune and waiting for the four oclock train iii there was music from my neighbours house through the summer nights in his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars at high tide in the afternoon i watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats slit the waters of the sound drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam on weekends his rollsroyce became an omnibus bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains and on mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbingbrushes and hammers and gardenshears repairing the ravages of the night before every friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in new yorkevery monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves there was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butlers thumb at least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a christmas tree of gatsbys enormous garden on buffet tables garnished with glistening horsdoeuvre spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold in the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another by seven oclock the orchestra has arrived no thin fivepiece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums the last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs the cars from new york are parked five deep in the drive and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours and hair bobbed in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of castile the bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each others names the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher laughter is easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tipped out at a cheerful word the groups change more swiftly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the same breath already there are wanderers confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable become for a sharp joyous moment the centre of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the seachange of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal seizes a cocktail out of the air dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform a momentary hush the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is gilda grays understudy from the follies the party has begun i believe that on the first night i went to gatsbys house i was one of the few guests who had actually been invited people were not invitedthey went there they got into automobiles which bore them out to long island and somehow they ended up at gatsbys door once there they were introduced by somebody who knew gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park sometimes they came and went without having met gatsby at all came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission i had been actually invited a chauffeur in a uniform of robinsegg blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer the honour would be entirely gatsbys it said if i would attend his little party that night he had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented itsigned jay gatsby in a majestic hand dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people i didnt knowthough here and there was a face i had noticed on the commuting train i was immediately struck by the number of young englishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous americans i was sure that they were selling something bonds or insurance or automobiles they were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail tablethe only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden welcome or not i found it necessary to attach myself to someone before i should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby hello i roared advancing toward her my voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden i thought you might be here she responded absently as i came up i remembered you lived next door to she held my hand impersonally as a promise that shed take care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps hello they cried together sorry you didnt win that was for the golf tournament she had lost in the finals the week before you dont know who we are said one of the girls in yellow but we met you here about a month ago youve dyed your hair since then remarked jordan and i started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon produced like the supper no doubt out of a caterers basket with jordans slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden a tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men each one introduced to us as mr mumble do you come to these parties often inquired jordan of the girl beside her the last one was the one i met you at answered the girl in an alert confident voice she turned to her companion wasnt it for you lucille it was for lucille too i like to come lucille said i never care what i do so i always have a good time when i was here last i tore my gown on a chair and he asked me my name and addressinside of a week i got a package from croiriers with a new evening gown in it did you keep it asked jordan sure i did i was going to wear it tonight but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered it was gas blue with lavender beads two hundred and sixtyfive dollars theres something funny about a fellow thatll do a thing like that said the other girl eagerly he doesnt want any trouble with anybody who doesnt i inquired gatsby somebody told me the two girls and jordan leaned together confidentially somebody told me they thought he killed a man once a thrill passed over all of us the three mr mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly i dont think its so much that argued lucille sceptically its more that he was a german spy during the war one of the men nodded in confirmation i heard that from a man who knew all about him grew up with him in germany he assured us positively oh no said the first girl it couldnt be that because he was in the american army during the war as our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm you look at him sometimes when he thinks nobodys looking at him ill bet he killed a man she narrowed her eyes and shivered lucille shivered we all turned and looked around for gatsby it was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world the first supperthere would be another one after midnightwas now being served and jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden there were three married couples and jordans escort a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countrysideeast egg condescending to west egg and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gaiety lets get out whispered jordan after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate halfhour this is much too polite for me we got up and she explained that we were going to find the host i had never met him she said and it was making me uneasy the undergraduate nodded in a cynical melancholy way the bar where we glanced first was crowded but gatsby was not there she couldnt find him from the top of the steps and he wasnt on the veranda on a chance we tried an importantlooking door and walked into a high gothic library panelled with carved english oak and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas a stout middleaged man with enormous owleyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books as we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined jordan from head to foot what do you think he demanded impetuously about what he waved his hand toward the bookshelves about that as a matter of fact you neednt bother to ascertain i ascertained theyre real the books he nodded absolutely realhave pages and everything i thought theyd be a nice durable cardboard matter of fact theyre absolutely real pages andhere lemme show you taking our scepticism for granted he rushed to the bookcases and returned with volume one of the stoddard lectures see he cried triumphantly its a bonafide piece of printed matter it fooled me this fellas a regular belasco its a triumph what thoroughness what realism knew when to stop toodidnt cut the pages but what do you want what do you expect he snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse who brought you he demanded or did you just come i was brought most people were brought jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answering i was brought by a woman named roosevelt he continued mrs claud roosevelt do you know her i met her somewhere last night ive been drunk for about a week now and i thought it might sober me up to sit in a library has it a little bit i think i cant tell yet ive only been here an hour did i tell you about the books theyre real theyre you told us we shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors there was dancing now on the canvas in the garden old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles superior couples holding each other tortuously fashionably and keeping in the cornersand a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps by midnight the hilarity had increased a celebrated tenor had sung in italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky a pair of stage twins who turned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than fingerbowls the moon had risen higher and floating in the sound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to the stiff tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn i was still with jordan baker we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter i was enjoying myself now i had taken two fingerbowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant elemental and profound at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled your face is familiar he said politely werent you in the first division during the war why yes i was in the twentyeighth infantry i was in the sixteenth until june nineteeneighteen i knew id seen you somewhere before we talked for a moment about some wet grey little villages in france evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning want to go with me old sport just near the shore along the sound what time any time that suits you best it was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when jordan looked around and smiled having a gay time now she inquired much better i turned again to my new acquaintance this is an unusual party for me i havent even seen the host i live over there i waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance and this man gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation for a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand im gatsby he said suddenly what i exclaimed oh i beg your pardon i thought you knew old sport im afraid im not a very good host he smiled understandinglymuch more than understandingly it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life it facedor seemed to facethe whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour it understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that at your best you hoped to convey precisely at that point it vanishedand i was looking at an elegant young roughneck a year or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd some time before he introduced himself id got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care almost at the moment when mr gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that chicago was calling him on the wire he excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn if you want anything just ask for it old sport he urged me excuse me i will rejoin you later when he was gone i turned immediately to jordanconstrained to assure her of my surprise i had expected that mr gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years who is he i demanded do you know hes just a man named gatsby where is he from i mean and what does he do now youre started on the subject she answered with a wan smile well he told me once he was an oxford man a dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away however i dont believe it why not i dont know she insisted i just dont think he went there something in her tone reminded me of the other girls i think he killed a man and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity i would have accepted without question the information that gatsby sprang from the swamps of louisiana or from the lower east side of new york that was comprehensible but young men didntat least in my provincial inexperience i believed they didntdrift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on long island sound anyhow he gives large parties said jordan changing the subject with an urban distaste for the concrete and i like large parties theyre so intimate at small parties there isnt any privacy there was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden ladies and gentlemen he cried at the request of mr gatsby we are going to play for you mr vladmir tostoffs latest work which attracted so much attention at carnegie hall last may if you read the papers you know there was a big sensation he smiled with jovial condescension and added some sensation whereupon everybody laughed the piece is known he concluded lustily as vladmir tostoffs jazz history of the world the nature of mr tostoffs composition eluded me because just as it began my eyes fell on gatsby standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes his tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day i could see nothing sinister about him i wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased when the jazz history of the world was over girls were putting their heads on mens shoulders in a puppyish convivial way girls were swooning backward playfully into mens arms even into groups knowing that someone would arrest their fallsbut no one swooned backward on gatsby and no french bob touched gatsbys shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with gatsbys head for one link i beg your pardon gatsbys butler was suddenly standing beside us miss baker he inquired i beg your pardon but mr gatsby would like to speak to you alone with me she exclaimed in surprise yes madame she got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment and followed the butler toward the house i noticed that she wore her eveningdress all her dresses like sports clothesthere was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean crisp mornings i was alone and it was almost two for some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long manywindowed room which overhung the terrace eluding jordans undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls and who implored me to join him i went inside the large room was full of people one of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall redhaired young lady from a famous chorus engaged in song she had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sadshe was not only singing she was weeping too whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano the tears coursed down her cheeksnot freely however for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets a humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep she had a fight with a man who says hes her husband explained a girl at my elbow i looked around most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands even jordans party the quartet from east egg were rent asunder by dissension one of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacksat intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond and hissed you promised into his ear the reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men the hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives the wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices whenever he sees im having a good time he wants to go home never heard anything so selfish in my life were always the first ones to leave so are we well were almost the last tonight said one of the men sheepishly the orchestra left half an hour ago in spite of the wives agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short struggle and both wives were lifted kicking into the night as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and jordan baker and gatsby came out together he was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye jordans party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands ive just heard the most amazing thing she whispered how long were we in there why about an hour it was simply amazing she repeated abstractedly but i swore i wouldnt tell it and here i am tantalizing you she yawned gracefully in my face please come and see me phone book under the name of mrs sigourney howard my aunt she was hurrying off as she talkedher brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door rather ashamed that on my first appearance i had stayed so late i joined the last of gatsbys guests who were clustered around him i wanted to explain that id hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden dont mention it he enjoined me eagerly dont give it another thought old sport the familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder and dont forget were going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine oclock then the butler behind his shoulder philadelphia wants you on the phone sir all right in a minute tell them ill be right there good night good night good night he smiledand suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go as if he had desired it all the time good night old sport good night but as i walked down the steps i saw that the evening was not quite over fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene in the ditch beside the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheel rested a new coup which had left gatsbys drive not two minutes before the sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs however as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene a man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road looking from the car to the tyre and from the tyre to the observers in a pleasant puzzled way see he explained it went in the ditch the fact was infinitely astonishing to him and i recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the manit was the late patron of gatsbys library howd it happen he shrugged his shoulders i know nothing whatever about mechanics he said decisively but how did it happen did you run into the wall dont ask me said owl eyes washing his hands of the whole matter i know very little about drivingnext to nothing it happened and thats all i know well if youre a poor driver you oughtnt to try driving at night but i wasnt even trying he explained indignantly i wasnt even trying an awed hush fell upon the bystanders do you want to commit suicide youre lucky it was just a wheel a bad driver and not even trying you dont understand explained the criminal i wasnt driving theres another man in the car the shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ahhh as the door of the coup swung slowly open the crowdit was now a crowdstepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause then very gradually part by part a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster whas matter he inquired calmly did we run outa gas look half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheelhe stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky it came off someone explained he nodded at first i din notice wed stopped a pause then taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice wonderff tell me where theres a gasline station at least a dozen men some of them a little better off than he was explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond back out he suggested after a moment put her in reverse but the wheels off he hesitated no harm in trying he said the caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and i turned away and cut across the lawn toward home i glanced back once a wafer of a moon was shining over gatsbys house making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden a sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell reading over what i have written so far i see i have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me on the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and until much later they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs most of the time i worked in the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as i hurried down the white chasms of lower new york to the probity trust i knew the other clerks and young bondsalesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee i even had a short affair with a girl who lived in jersey city and worked in the accounting department but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in july i let it blow quietly away i took dinner usually at the yale clubfor some reason it was the gloomiest event of my dayand then i went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour there were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work after that if the night was mellow i strolled down madison avenue past the old murray hill hotel and over 33rd street to the pennsylvania station i began to like new york the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye i liked to walk up fifth avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes i was going to enter into their lives and no one would ever know or disapprove sometimes in my mind i followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in otherspoor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinneryoung clerks in the dusk wasting the most poignant moments of night and life again at eight oclock when the dark lanes of the forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs bound for the theatre district i felt a sinking in my heart forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited and voices sang and there was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside imagining that i too was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate excitement i wished them well for a while i lost sight of jordan baker and then in midsummer i found her again at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her name then it was something more i wasnt actually in love but i felt a sort of tender curiosity the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed somethingmost affectations conceal something eventually even though they dont in the beginningand one day i found what it was when we were on a houseparty together up in warwick she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down and then lied about itand suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisys at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapersa suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round the thing approached the proportions of a scandalthen died away a caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken the incident and the name had remained together in my mind jordan baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible she was incurably dishonest she wasnt able to endure being at a disadvantage and given this unwillingness i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body it made no difference to me dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeplyi was casually sorry and then i forgot it was on that same houseparty that we had a curious conversation about driving a car it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one mans coat youre a rotten driver i protested either you ought to be more careful or you oughtnt to drive at all i am careful no youre not well other people are she said lightly whats that got to do with it theyll keep out of my way she insisted it takes two to make an accident suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself i hope i never will she answered i hate careless people thats why i like you her grey sunstrained eyes stared straight ahead but she had deliberately shifted our relations and for a moment i thought i loved her but i am slowthinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires and i knew that first i had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home id been writing letters once a week and signing them love nick and all i could think of was how when that certain girl played tennis a faint moustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before i was free everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues and this is mine i am one of the few honest people that i have ever known iv on sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore the world and its mistress returned to gatsbys house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn hes a bootlegger said the young ladies moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers one time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von hindenburg and second cousin to the devil reach me a rose honey and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass once i wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of those who came to gatsbys house that summer it is an old timetable now disintegrating at its folds and headed this schedule in effect july 5th 1922 but i can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted gatsbys hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him from east egg then came the chester beckers and the leeches and a man named bunsen whom i knew at yale and doctor webster civet who was drowned last summer up in maine and the hornbeams and the willie voltaires and a whole clan named blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near and the ismays and the chrysties or rather hubert auerbach and mr chrysties wife and edgar beaver whose hair they say turned cottonwhite one winter afternoon for no good reason at all clarence endive was from east egg as i remember he came only once in white knickerbockers and had a fight with a bum named etty in the garden from farther out on the island came the cheadles and the o r p schraeders and the stonewall jackson abrams of georgia and the fishguards and the ripley snells snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary so drunk out on the gravel drive that mrs ulysses swetts automobile ran over his right hand the dancies came too and s b whitebait who was well over sixty and maurice a flink and the hammerheads and beluga the tobacco importer and belugas girls from west egg came the poles and the mulreadys and cecil roebuck and cecil schoen and gulick the state senator and newton orchid who controlled films par excellence and eckhaust and clyde cohen and don s schwartz the son and arthur mccarty all connected with the movies in one way or another and the catlips and the bembergs and g earl muldoon brother to that muldoon who afterward strangled his wife da fontano the promoter came there and ed legros and james b rotgut ferret and the de jongs and ernest lillythey came to gamble and when ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and associated traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day a man named klipspringer was there so often that he became known as the boarderi doubt if he had any other home of theatrical people there were gus waize and horace odonavan and lester myer and george duckweed and francis bull also from new york were the chromes and the backhyssons and the dennickers and russel betty and the corrigans and the kellehers and the dewars and the scullys and s w belcher and the smirkes and the young quinns divorced now and henry l palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in times square benny mcclenahan arrived always with four girls they were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before i have forgotten their namesjaqueline i think or else consuela or gloria or judy or june and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great american capitalists whose cousins if pressed they would confess themselves to be in addition to all these i can remember that faustina obrien came there at least once and the baedeker girls and young brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and mr albrucksburger and miss haag his fiance and ardita fitzpeters and mr p jewett once head of the american legion and miss claudia hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur and a prince of something whom we called duke and whose name if i ever knew it i have forgotten all these people came to gatsbys house in the summer at nine oclock one morning late in july gatsbys gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its threenoted horn it was the first time he had called on me though i had gone to two of his parties mounted in his hydroplane and at his urgent invitation made frequent use of his beach good morning old sport youre having lunch with me today and i thought wed ride up together he was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly americanthat comes i suppose with the absence of lifting work in youth and even more with the formless grace of our nervous sporadic games this quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness he was never quite still there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand he saw me looking with admiration at his car its pretty isnt it old sport he jumped off to give me a better view havent you ever seen it before id seen it everybody had seen it it was a rich cream colour bright with nickel swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supperboxes and toolboxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town i had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found to my disappointment that he had little to say so my first impression that he was a person of some undefined consequence had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door and then came that disconcerting ride we hadnt reached west egg village before gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramelcoloured suit look here old sport he broke out surprisingly whats your opinion of me anyhow a little overwhelmed i began the generalized evasions which that question deserves well im going to tell you something about my life he interrupted i dont want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear so he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls ill tell you gods truth his right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by i am the son of some wealthy people in the middle westall dead now i was brought up in america but educated at oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years it is a family tradition he looked at me sidewaysand i knew why jordan baker had believed he was lying he hurried the phrase educated at oxford or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before and with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and i wondered if there wasnt something a little sinister about him after all what part of the middle west i inquired casually san francisco i see my family all died and i came into a good deal of money his voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him for a moment i suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise after that i lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of europeparis venice romecollecting jewels chiefly rubies hunting big game painting a little things for myself only and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago with an effort i managed to restrain my incredulous laughter the very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned character leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the bois de boulogne then came the war old sport it was a great relief and i tried very hard to die but i seemed to bear an enchanted life i accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began in the argonne forest i took the remains of my machinegun battalion so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldnt advance we stayed there two days and two nights a hundred and thirty men with sixteen lewis guns and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three german divisions among the piles of dead i was promoted to be a major and every allied government gave me a decorationeven montenegro little montenegro down on the adriatic sea little montenegro he lifted up the words and nodded at themwith his smile the smile comprehended montenegros troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the montenegrin people it appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from montenegros warm little heart my incredulity was submerged in fascination now it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines he reached in his pocket and a piece of metal slung on a ribbon fell into my palm thats the one from montenegro to my astonishment the thing had an authentic look orderi di danilo ran the circular legend montenegro nicolas rex turn it major jay gatsby i read for valour extraordinary heres another thing i always carry a souvenir of oxford days it was taken in trinity quadthe man on my left is now the earl of doncaster it was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires there was gatsby looking a little not much youngerwith a cricket bat in his hand then it was all true i saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the grand canal i saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease with their crimsonlighted depths the gnawings of his broken heart im going to make a big request of you today he said pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction so i thought you ought to know something about me i didnt want you to think i was just some nobody you see i usually find myself among strangers because i drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me he hesitated youll hear about it this afternoon at lunch no this afternoon i happened to find out that youre taking miss baker to tea do you mean youre in love with miss baker no old sport im not but miss baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter i hadnt the faintest idea what this matter was but i was more annoyed than interested i hadnt asked jordan to tea in order to discuss mr jay gatsby i was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment i was sorry id ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn he wouldnt say another word his correctness grew on him as we neared the city we passed port roosevelt where there was a glimpse of redbelted oceangoing ships and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undeserted saloons of the fadedgilt nineteenhundreds then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us and i had a glimpse of mrs wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by with fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half astoriaonly half for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated i heard the familiar jugjugspat of a motorcycle and a frantic policeman rode alongside all right old sport called gatsby we slowed down taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the mans eyes right you are agreed the policeman tipping his cap know you next time mr gatsby excuse me what was that i inquired the picture of oxford i was able to do the commissioner a favour once and he sends me a christmas card every year over the great bridge with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money the city seen from the queensboro bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world a dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends the friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of southeastern europe and i was glad that the sight of gatsbys splendid car was included in their sombre holiday as we crossed blackwells island a limousine passed us driven by a white chauffeur in which sat three modish negroes two bucks and a girl i laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry anything can happen now that weve slid over this bridge i thought anything at all even gatsby could happen without any particular wonder roaring noon in a wellfanned fortysecond street cellar i met gatsby for lunch blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom talking to another man mr carraway this is my friend mr wolfshiem a small flatnosed jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril after a moment i discovered his tiny eyes in the halfdarkness so i took one look at him said mr wolfshiem shaking my hand earnestly and what do you think i did what i inquired politely but evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered gatsby with his expressive nose i handed the money to katspaugh and i said all right katspaugh dont pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth he shut it then and there gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon mr wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction highballs asked the head waiter this is a nice restaurant here said mr wolfshiem looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling but i like across the street better yes highballs agreed gatsby and then to mr wolfshiem its too hot over there hot and smallyes said mr wolfshiem but full of memories what place is that i asked the old metropole the old metropole brooded mr wolfshiem gloomily filled with faces dead and gone filled with friends gone now forever i cant forget so long as i live the night they shot rosy rosenthal there it was six of us at the table and rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening when it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside all right says rosy and begins to get up and i pulled him down in his chair let the bastards come in here if they want you rosy but dont you so help me move outside this room it was four oclock in the morning then and if wed of raised the blinds wed of seen daylight did he go i asked innocently sure he went mr wolfshiems nose flashed at me indignantly he turned around in the door and says dont let that waiter take away my coffee then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away four of them were electrocuted i said remembering five with becker his nostrils turned to me in an interested way i understand youre looking for a business gonnegtion the juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling gatsby answered for me oh no he exclaimed this isnt the man no mr wolfshiem seemed disappointed this is just a friend i told you wed talk about that some other time i beg your pardon said mr wolfshiem i had a wrong man a succulent hash arrived and mr wolfshiem forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old metropole began to eat with ferocious delicacy his eyes meanwhile roved very slowly all around the roomhe completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind i think that except for my presence he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table look here old sport said gatsby leaning toward me im afraid i made you a little angry this morning in the car there was the smile again but this time i held out against it i dont like mysteries i answered and i dont understand why you wont come out frankly and tell me what you want why has it all got to come through miss baker oh its nothing underhand he assured me miss bakers a great sportswoman you know and shed never do anything that wasnt all right suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with mr wolfshiem at the table he has to telephone said mr wolfshiem following him with his eyes fine fellow isnt he handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman yes hes an oggsford man oh he went to oggsford college in england you know oggsford college ive heard of it its one of the most famous colleges in the world have you known gatsby for a long time i inquired several years he answered in a gratified way i made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war but i knew i had discovered a man of fine breeding after i talked with him an hour i said to myself theres the kind of man youd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister he paused i see youre looking at my cuff buttons i hadnt been looking at them but i did now they were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory finest specimens of human molars he informed me well i inspected them thats a very interesting idea yeah he flipped his sleeves up under his coat yeah gatsbys very careful about women he would never so much as look at a friends wife when the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down mr wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet i have enjoyed my lunch he said and im going to run off from you two young men before i outstay my welcome dont hurry meyer said gatsby without enthusiasm mr wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction youre very polite but i belong to another generation he announced solemnly you sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your he supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand as for me i am fifty years old and i wont impose myself on you any longer as he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling i wondered if i had said anything to offend him he becomes very sentimental sometimes explained gatsby this is one of his sentimental days hes quite a character around new yorka denizen of broadway who is he anyhow an actor no a dentist meyer wolfshiem no hes a gambler gatsby hesitated then added coolly hes the man who fixed the worlds series back in 1919 fixed the worlds series i repeated the idea staggered me i remembered of course that the worlds series had been fixed in 1919 but if i had thought of it at all i would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened the end of some inevitable chain it never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million peoplewith the singlemindedness of a burglar blowing a safe how did he happen to do that i asked after a minute he just saw the opportunity why isnt he in jail they cant get him old sport hes a smart man i insisted on paying the check as the waiter brought my change i caught sight of tom buchanan across the crowded room come along with me for a minute i said ive got to say hello to someone when he saw us tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction whereve you been he demanded eagerly daisys furious because you havent called up this is mr gatsby mr buchanan they shook hands briefly and a strained unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over gatsbys face howve you been anyhow demanded tom of me howd you happen to come up this far to eat ive been having lunch with mr gatsby i turned toward mr gatsby but he was no longer there one october day in nineteenseventeen said jordan baker that afternoon sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the teagarden at the plaza hotel i was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns i was happier on the lawns because i had on shoes from england with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground i had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tuttuttuttut in a disapproving way the largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to daisy fays house she was just eighteen two years older than me and by far the most popular of all the young girls in louisville she dressed in white and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from camp taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night anyways for an hour when i came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant i had never seen before they were so engrossed in each other that she didnt see me until i was five feet away hello jordan she called unexpectedly please come here i was flattered that she wanted to speak to me because of all the older girls i admired her most she asked me if i was going to the red cross to make bandages i was well then would i tell them that she couldnt come that day the officer looked at daisy while she was speaking in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime and because it seemed romantic to me i have remembered the incident ever since his name was jay gatsby and i didnt lay eyes on him again for over four yearseven after id met him on long island i didnt realize it was the same man that was nineteenseventeen by the next year i had a few beaux myself and i began to play in tournaments so i didnt see daisy very often she went with a slightly older crowdwhen she went with anyone at all wild rumours were circulating about herhow her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to new york and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas she was effectually prevented but she wasnt on speaking terms with her family for several weeks after that she didnt play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flatfooted shortsighted young men in town who couldnt get into the army at all by the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever she had a dbut after the armistice and in february she was presumably engaged to a man from new orleans in june she married tom buchanan of chicago with more pomp and circumstance than louisville ever knew before he came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the muhlbach hotel and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars i was a bridesmaid i came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the june night in her flowered dressand as drunk as a monkey she had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other gratulate me she muttered never had a drink before but oh how i do enjoy it whats the matter daisy i was scared i can tell you id never seen a girl like that before here dearies she groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls take em downstairs and give em back to whoever they belong to tell em all daisys change her mine say daisys change her mine she began to cryshe cried and cried i rushed out and found her mothers maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath she wouldnt let go of the letter she took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball and only let me leave it in the soapdish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow but she didnt say another word we gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over next day at five oclock she married tom buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months trip to the south seas i saw them in santa barbara when they came back and i thought id never seen a girl so mad about her husband if he left the room for a minute shed look around uneasily and say wheres tom gone and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door she used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight it was touching to see them togetherit made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way that was in august a week after i left santa barbara tom ran into a wagon on the ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car the girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was brokenshe was one of the chambermaids in the santa barbara hotel the next april daisy had her little girl and they went to france for a year i saw them one spring in cannes and later in deauville and then they came back to chicago to settle down daisy was popular in chicago as you know they moved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich and wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation perhaps because she doesnt drink its a great advantage not to drink among harddrinking people you can hold your tongue and moreover you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they dont see or care perhaps daisy never went in for amour at alland yet theres something in that voice of hers well about six weeks ago she heard the name gatsby for the first time in years it was when i asked youdo you rememberif you knew gatsby in west egg after you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up and said what gatsby and when i described himi was half asleepshe said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know it wasnt until then that i connected this gatsby with the officer in her white car when jordan baker had finished telling all this we had left the plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through central park the sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the west fifties and the clear voices of children already gathered like crickets on the grass rose through the hot twilight im the sheik of araby your love belongs to me at night when youre asleep into your tent ill creep it was a strange coincidence i said but it wasnt a coincidence at all why not gatsby bought that house so that daisy would be just across the bay then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that june night he came alive to me delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendour he wants to know continued jordan if youll invite daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over the modesty of the demand shook me he had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual mothsso that he could come over some afternoon to a strangers garden did i have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing hes afraid hes waited so long he thought you might be offended you see hes regular tough underneath it all something worried me why didnt he ask you to arrange a meeting he wants her to see his house she explained and your house is right next door oh i think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties some night went on jordan but she never did then he began asking people casually if they knew her and i was the first one he found it was that night he sent for me at his dance and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it of course i immediately suggested a luncheon in new yorkand i thought hed go mad i dont want to do anything out of the way he kept saying i want to see her right next door when i said you were a particular friend of toms he started to abandon the whole idea he doesnt know very much about tom though he says hes read a chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of daisys name it was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridge i put my arm around jordans golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner suddenly i wasnt thinking of daisy and gatsby any more but of this clean hard limited person who dealt in universal scepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm a phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement there are only the pursued the pursuing the busy and the tired and daisy ought to have something in her life murmured jordan to me does she want to see gatsby shes not to know about it gatsby doesnt want her to know youre just supposed to invite her to tea we passed a barrier of dark trees and then the faade of fiftyninth street a block of delicate pale light beamed down into the park unlike gatsby and tom buchanan i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so i drew up the girl beside me tightening my arms her wan scornful mouth smiled and so i drew her up again closer this time to my face v when i came home to west egg that night i was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire two oclock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires turning a corner i saw that it was gatsbys house lit from tower to cellar at first i thought it was another party a wild rout that had resolved itself into hideandgoseek or sardinesinthebox with all the house thrown open to the game but there wasnt a sound only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness as my taxi groaned away i saw gatsby walking toward me across his lawn your place looks like the worlds fair i said does it he turned his eyes toward it absently i have been glancing into some of the rooms lets go to coney island old sport in my car its too late well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool i havent made use of it all summer ive got to go to bed all right he waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness i talked with miss baker i said after a moment im going to call up daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea oh thats all right he said carelessly i dont want to put you to any trouble what day would suit you what day would suit you he corrected me quickly i dont want to put you to any trouble you see how about the day after tomorrow he considered for a moment then with reluctance i want to get the grass cut he said we both looked down at the grassthere was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker wellkept expanse of his began i suspected that he meant my grass theres another little thing he said uncertainly and hesitated would you rather put it off for a few days i asked oh it isnt about that at least he fumbled with a series of beginnings why i thoughtwhy look here old sport you dont make much money do you not very much this seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently i thought you didnt if youll pardon myyou see i carry on a little business on the side a sort of side line you understand and i thought that if you dont make very muchyoure selling bonds arent you old sport trying to well this would interest you it wouldnt take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money it happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing i realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life but because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered i had no choice except to cut him off there ive got my hands full i said im much obliged but i couldnt take on any more work you wouldnt have to do any business with wolfshiem evidently he thought that i was shying away from the gonnegtion mentioned at lunch but i assured him he was wrong he waited a moment longer hoping id begin a conversation but i was too absorbed to be responsive so he went unwillingly home the evening had made me lightheaded and happy i think i walked into a deep sleep as i entered my front door so i dont know whether or not gatsby went to coney island or for how many hours he glanced into rooms while his house blazed gaudily on i called up daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea dont bring tom i warned her what dont bring tom who is tom she asked innocently the day agreed upon was pouring rain at eleven oclock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawnmower tapped at my front door and said that mr gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass this reminded me that i had forgotten to tell my finn to come back so i drove into west egg village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers the flowers were unnecessary for at two oclock a greenhouse arrived from gatsbys with innumerable receptacles to contain it an hour later the front door opened nervously and gatsby in a white flannel suit silver shirt and goldcoloured tie hurried in he was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes is everything all right he asked immediately the grass looks fine if thats what you mean what grass he inquired blankly oh the grass in the yard he looked out the window at it but judging from his expression i dont believe he saw a thing looks very good he remarked vaguely one of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four i think it was the journal have you got everything you need in the shape ofof tea i took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the finn together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop will they do i asked of course of course theyre fine and he added hollowly old sport the rain cooled about halfpast three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of clays economics starting at the finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering towards the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home whys that nobodys coming to tea its too late he looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere i cant wait all day dont be silly its just two minutes to four he sat down miserably as if i had pushed him and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane we both jumped up and a little harrowed myself i went out into the yard under the dripping bare lilactrees a large open car was coming up the drive it stopped daisys face tipped sideways beneath a threecornered lavender hat looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile is this absolutely where you live my dearest one the exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain i had to follow the sound of it for a moment up and down with my ear alone before any words came through a damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as i took it to help her from the car are you in love with me she said low in my ear or why did i have to come alone thats the secret of castle rackrent tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour come back in an hour ferdie then in a grave murmur his name is ferdie does the gasoline affect his nose i dont think so she said innocently why we went in to my overwhelming surprise the livingroom was deserted well thats funny i exclaimed whats funny she turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door i went out and opened it gatsby pale as death with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the livingroom it wasnt a bit funny aware of the loud beating of my own heart i pulled the door to against the increasing rain for half a minute there wasnt a sound then from the livingroom i heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by daisys voice on a clear artificial note i certainly am awfully glad to see you again a pause it endured horribly i had nothing to do in the hall so i went into the room gatsby his hands still in his pockets was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease even of boredom his head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair weve met before muttered gatsby his eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place then he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand im sorry about the clock he said my own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn i couldnt muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head its an old clock i told them idiotically i think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor we havent met for many years said daisy her voice as matteroffact as it could ever be five years next november the automatic quality of gatsbys answer set us all back at least another minute i had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac finn brought it in on a tray amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself gatsby got himself into a shadow and while daisy and i talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes however as calmness wasnt an end in itself i made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet where are you going demanded gatsby in immediate alarm ill be back ive got to speak to you about something before you go he followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the door and whispered oh god in a miserable way whats the matter this is a terrible mistake he said shaking his head from side to side a terrible terrible mistake youre just embarrassed thats all and luckily i added daisys embarrassed too shes embarrassed he repeated incredulously just as much as you are dont talk so loud youre acting like a little boy i broke out impatiently not only that but youre rude daisys sitting in there all alone he raised his hand to stop my words looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room i walked out the back wayjust as gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour beforeand ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn wellshaved by gatsbys gardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes there was nothing to look at from under the tree except gatsbys enormous house so i stared at it like kant at his church steeple for half an hour a brewer had built it early in the period craze a decade before and there was a story that hed agreed to pay five years taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to found a familyhe went into an immediate decline his children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door americans while willing even eager to be serfs have always been obstinate about being peasantry after half an hour the sun shone again and the grocers automobile rounded gatsbys drive with the raw material for his servants dinneri felt sure he wouldnt eat a spoonful a maid began opening the upper windows of his house appeared momentarily in each and leaning from the large central bay spat meditatively into the garden it was time i went back while the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion but in the new silence i felt that silence had fallen within the house too i went inafter making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stovebut i dont believe they heard a sound they were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment was gone daisys face was smeared with tears and when i came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror but there was a change in gatsby that was simply confounding he literally glowed without a word or a gesture of exultation a new wellbeing radiated from him and filled the little room oh hello old sport he said as if he hadnt seen me for years i thought for a moment he was going to shake hands its stopped raining has it when he realized what i was talking about that there were twinklebells of sunshine in the room he smiled like a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light and repeated the news to daisy what do you think of that its stopped raining im glad jay her throat full of aching grieving beauty told only of her unexpected joy i want you and daisy to come over to my house he said id like to show her around youre sure you want me to come absolutely old sport daisy went upstairs to wash her facetoo late i thought with humiliation of my towelswhile gatsby and i waited on the lawn my house looks well doesnt it he demanded see how the whole front of it catches the light i agreed that it was splendid yes his eyes went over it every arched door and square tower it took me just three years to earn the money that bought it i thought you inherited your money i did old sport he said automatically but i lost most of it in the big panicthe panic of the war i think he hardly knew what he was saying for when i asked him what business he was in he answered thats my affair before he realized that it wasnt an appropriate reply oh ive been in several things he corrected himself i was in the drug business and then i was in the oil business but im not in either one now he looked at me with more attention do you mean youve been thinking over what i proposed the other night before i could answer daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight that huge place there she cried pointing do you like it i love it but i dont see how you live there all alone i keep it always full of interesting people night and day people who do interesting things celebrated people instead of taking the shortcut along the sound we went down to the road and entered by the big postern with enchanting murmurs daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy odour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of kissmeatthegate it was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees and inside as we wandered through marie antoinette musicrooms and restoration salons i felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through as gatsby closed the door of the merton college library i could have sworn i heard the owleyed man break into ghostly laughter we went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers through dressingrooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunken bathsintruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor it was mr klipspringer the boarder i had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning finally we came to gatsbys own apartment a bedroom and a bath and an adams study where we sat down and drank a glass of some chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall he hadnt once ceased looking at daisy and i think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her wellloved eyes sometimes too he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs his bedroom was the simplest room of allexcept where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair whereupon gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh its the funniest thing old sport he said hilariously i cantwhen i try to he had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third after his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence he had been full of the idea so long dreamed it right through to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at an inconceivable pitch of intensity now in the reaction he was running down like an overwound clock recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressinggowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high ive got a man in england who buys me clothes he sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season spring and fall he took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them one by one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in manycoloured disarray while we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted highershirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and applegreen and lavender and faint orange with monograms of indian blue suddenly with a strained sound daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily theyre such beautiful shirts she sobbed her voice muffled in the thick folds it makes me sad because ive never seen suchsuch beautiful shirts before after the house we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowersbut outside gatsbys window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the sound if it wasnt for the mist we could see your home across the bay said gatsby you always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever compared to the great distance that had separated him from daisy it had seemed very near to her almost touching her it had seemed as close as a star to the moon now it was again a green light on a dock his count of enchanted objects had diminished by one i began to walk about the room examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness a large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung on the wall over his desk whos this that thats mr dan cody old sport the name sounded faintly familiar hes dead now he used to be my best friend years ago there was a small picture of gatsby also in yachting costume on the bureaugatsby with his head thrown back defiantlytaken apparently when he was about eighteen i adore it exclaimed daisy the pompadour you never told me you had a pompadouror a yacht look at this said gatsby quickly heres a lot of clippingsabout you they stood side by side examining it i was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and gatsby took up the receiver yes well i cant talk now i cant talk now old sport i said a small town he must know what a small town is well hes no use to us if detroit is his idea of a small town he rang off come here quick cried daisy at the window the rain was still falling but the darkness had parted in the west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea look at that she whispered and then after a moment id like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around i tried to go then but they wouldnt hear of it perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone i know what well do said gatsby well have klipspringer play the piano he went out of the room calling ewing and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slightly worn young man with shellrimmed glasses and scanty blond hair he was now decently clothed in a sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue did we interrupt your exercise inquired daisy politely i was asleep cried mr klipspringer in a spasm of embarrassment that is id been asleep then i got up klipspringer plays the piano said gatsby cutting him off dont you ewing old sport i dont play well i donthardly play at all im all out of prac well go downstairs interrupted gatsby he flipped a switch the grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light in the musicroom gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano he lit daisys cigarette from a trembling match and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall when klipspringer had played the love nest he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for gatsby in the gloom im all out of practice you see i told you i couldnt play im all out of prac dont talk so much old sport commanded gatsby play in the morning in the evening aint we got fun outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the sound all the lights were going on in west egg now the electric trains mencarrying were plunging home through the rain from new york it was the hour of a profound human change and excitement was generating on the air one things sure and nothings surer the rich get richer and the poor getchildren in the meantime in between time as i went over to say goodbye i saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into gatsbys face as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness almost five years there must have been moments even that afternoon when daisy tumbled short of his dreamsnot through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion it had gone beyond her beyond everything he had thrown himself into it with a creative passion adding to it all the time decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way no amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart as i watched him he adjusted himself a little visibly his hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion i think that voice held him most with its fluctuating feverish warmth because it couldnt be overdreamedthat voice was a deathless song they had forgotten me but daisy glanced up and held out her hand gatsby didnt know me now at all i looked once more at them and they looked back at me remotely possessed by intense life then i went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain leaving them there together vi about this time an ambitious young reporter from new york arrived one morning at gatsbys door and asked him if he had anything to say anything to say about what inquired gatsby politely whyany statement to give out it transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard gatsbys name around his office in a connection which he either wouldnt reveal or didnt fully understand this was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out to see it was a random shot and yet the reporters instinct was right gatsbys notoriety spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities upon his past had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news contemporary legends such as the underground pipeline to canada attached themselves to him and there was one persistent story that he didnt live in a house at all but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the long island shore just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota isnt easy to say james gatzthat was really or at least legally his name he had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his careerwhen he saw dan codys yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior it was james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a rowboat pulled out to the tuolomee and informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour i suppose hed had the name ready for a long time even then his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm peoplehis imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all the truth was that jay gatsby of west egg long island sprang from his platonic conception of himself he was a son of goda phrase which if it means anything means just thatand he must be about his fathers business the service of a vast vulgar and meretricious beauty so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeenyearold boy would be likely to invent and to this conception he was faithful to the end for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of lake superior as a clamdigger and a salmonfisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed his brown hardening body lived naturally through the halffierce halflazy work of the bracing days he knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them of young virgins because they were ignorant of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming selfabsorption he took for granted but his heart was in a constant turbulent riot the most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night a universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace for a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairys wing an instinct toward his future glory had led him some months before to the small lutheran college of st olafs in southern minnesota he stayed there two weeks dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny to destiny itself and despising the janitors work with which he was to pay his way through then he drifted back to lake superior and he was still searching for something to do on the day that dan codys yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore cody was fifty years old then a product of the nevada silver fields of the yukon of every rush for metal since seventyfive the transactions in montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of softmindedness and suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money the none too savoury ramifications by which ella kaye the newspaper woman played madame de maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902 he had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as james gatzs destiny in little girl bay to young gatz resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world i suppose he smiled at codyhe had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled at any rate cody asked him a few questions one of them elicited the brand new name and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious a few days later he took him to duluth and bought him a blue coat six pairs of white duck trousers and a yachting cap and when the tuolomee left for the west indies and the barbary coast gatsby left too he was employed in a vague personal capacitywhile he remained with cody he was in turn steward mate skipper secretary and even jailor for dan cody sober knew what lavish doings dan cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in gatsby the arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent it might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that ella kaye came on board one night in boston and a week later dan cody inhospitably died i remember the portrait of him up in gatsbys bedroom a grey florid man with a hard empty facethe pioneer debauchee who during one phase of american life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon it was indirectly due to cody that gatsby drank so little sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone and it was from cody that he inherited moneya legacy of twentyfive thousand dollars he didnt get it he never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to ella kaye he was left with his singularly appropriate education the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man he told me all this very much later but ive put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents which werent even faintly true moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion when i had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him so i take advantage of this short halt while gatsby so to speak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptions away it was a halt too in my association with his affairs for several weeks i didnt see him or hear his voice on the phonemostly i was in new york trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile auntbut finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon i hadnt been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink i was startled naturally but the really surprising thing was that it hadnt happened before they were a party of three on horsebacktom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown ridinghabit who had been there previously im delighted to see you said gatsby standing on his porch im delighted that you dropped in as though they cared sit right down have a cigarette or a cigar he walked around the room quickly ringing bells ill have something to drink for you in just a minute he was profoundly affected by the fact that tom was there but he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for mr sloane wanted nothing a lemonade no thanks a little champagne nothing at all thanks im sorry did you have a nice ride very good roads around here i suppose the automobiles yeah moved by an irresistible impulse gatsby turned to tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger i believe weve met somewhere before mr buchanan oh yes said tom gruffly polite but obviously not remembering so we did i remember very well about two weeks ago thats right you were with nick here i know your wife continued gatsby almost aggressively that so tom turned to me you live near here nick next door that so mr sloane didnt enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing eitheruntil unexpectedly after two highballs she became cordial well all come over to your next party mr gatsby she suggested what do you say certainly id be delighted to have you be ver nice said mr sloane without gratitude wellthink ought to be starting home please dont hurry gatsby urged them he had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of tom why dont youwhy dont you stay for supper i wouldnt be surprised if some other people dropped in from new york you come to supper with me said the lady enthusiastically both of you this included me mr sloane got to his feet come along he saidbut to her only i mean it she insisted id love to have you lots of room gatsby looked at me questioningly he wanted to go and he didnt see that mr sloane had determined he shouldnt im afraid i wont be able to i said well you come she urged concentrating on gatsby mr sloane murmured something close to her ear we wont be late if we start now she insisted aloud i havent got a horse said gatsby i used to ride in the army but ive never bought a horse ill have to follow you in my car excuse me for just a minute the rest of us walked out on the porch where sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside my god i believe the mans coming said tom doesnt he know she doesnt want him she says she does want him she has a big dinner party and he wont know a soul there he frowned i wonder where in the devil he met daisy by god i may be oldfashioned in my ideas but women run around too much these days to suit me they meet all kinds of crazy fish suddenly mr sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses come on said mr sloane to tom were late weve got to go and then to me tell him we couldnt wait will you tom and i shook hands the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearing under the august foliage just as gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door tom was evidently perturbed at daisys running around alone for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsbys party perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressivenessit stands out in my memory from gatsbys other parties that summer there were the same people or at least the same sort of people the same profusion of champagne the same manycoloured manykeyed commotion but i felt an unpleasantness in the air a pervading harshness that hadnt been there before or perhaps i had merely grown used to it grown to accept west egg as a world complete in itself with its own standards and its own great figures second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so and now i was looking at it again through daisys eyes it is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment they arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds daisys voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat these things excite me so she whispered if you want to kiss me any time during the evening nick just let me know and ill be glad to arrange it for you just mention my name or present a green card im giving out green look around suggested gatsby im looking around im having a marvellous you must see the faces of many people youve heard about toms arrogant eyes roamed the crowd we dont go around very much he said in fact i was just thinking i dont know a soul here perhaps you know that lady gatsby indicated a gorgeous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a whiteplum tree tom and daisy stared with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies shes lovely said daisy the man bending over her is her director he took them ceremoniously from group to group mrs buchanan and mr buchanan after an instants hesitation he added the polo player oh no objected tom quickly not me but evidently the sound of it pleased gatsby for tom remained the polo player for the rest of the evening ive never met so many celebrities daisy exclaimed i liked that manwhat was his namewith the sort of blue nose gatsby identified him adding that he was a small producer well i liked him anyhow id a little rather not be the polo player said tom pleasantly id rather look at all these famous people inin oblivion daisy and gatsby danced i remember being surprised by his graceful conservative foxtroti had never seen him dance before then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request i remained watchfully in the garden in case theres a fire or a flood she explained or any act of god tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together do you mind if i eat with some people over here he said a fellows getting off some funny stuff go ahead answered daisy genially and if you want to take down any addresses heres my little gold pencil she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty and i knew that except for the halfhour shed been alone with gatsby she wasnt having a good time we were at a particularly tipsy table that was my faultgatsby had been called to the phone and id enjoyed these same people only two weeks before but what had amused me then turned septic on the air now how do you feel miss baedeker the girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slump against my shoulder at this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes wha a massive and lethargic woman who had been urging daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spoke in miss baedekers defence oh shes all right now when shes had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that i tell her she ought to leave it alone i do leave it alone affirmed the accused hollowly we heard you yelling so i said to doc civet here theres somebody that needs your help doc shes much obliged im sure said another friend without gratitude but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool anything i hate is to get my head stuck in a pool mumbled miss baedeker they almost drowned me once over in new jersey then you ought to leave it alone countered doctor civet speak for yourself cried miss baedeker violently your hand shakes i wouldnt let you operate on me it was like that almost the last thing i remember was standing with daisy and watching the movingpicture director and his star they were still under the whiteplum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between it occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity and even while i watched i saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek i like her said daisy i think shes lovely but the rest offended herand inarguably because it wasnt a gesture but an emotion she was appalled by west egg this unprecedented place that broadway had begotten upon a long island fishing villageappalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing she saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand i sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car it was dark here in front only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning sometimes a shadow moved against a dressingroom blind above gave way to another shadow an indefinite procession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass who is this gatsby anyhow demanded tom suddenly some big bootlegger whered you hear that i inquired i didnt hear it i imagined it a lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers you know not gatsby i said shortly he was silent for a moment the pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet well he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together a breeze stirred the grey haze of daisys fur collar at least they are more interesting than the people we know she said with an effort you didnt look so interested well i was tom laughed and turned to me did you notice daisys face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again when the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it in a way contralto voices have and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air lots of people come who havent been invited she said suddenly that girl hadnt been invited they simply force their way in and hes too polite to object id like to know who he is and what he does insisted tom and i think ill make a point of finding out i can tell you right now she answered he owned some drugstores a lot of drugstores he built them up himself the dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive good night nick said daisy her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where three oclock in the morning a neat sad little waltz of that year was drifting out the open door after all in the very casualness of gatsbys party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world what was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside what would happen now in the dim incalculable hours perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at gatsby one moment of magical encounter would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion i stayed late that night gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and i lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up chilled and exalted from the black beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead when he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and his eyes were bright and tired she didnt like it he said immediately of course she did she didnt like it he insisted she didnt have a good time he was silent and i guessed at his unutterable depression i feel far away from her he said its hard to make her understand you mean about the dance the dance he dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers old sport the dance is unimportant he wanted nothing less of daisy than that she should go to tom and say i never loved you after she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken one of them was that after she was free they were to go back to louisville and be married from her housejust as if it were five years ago and she doesnt understand he said she used to be able to understand wed sit for hours he broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers i wouldnt ask too much of her i ventured you cant repeat the past cant repeat the past he cried incredulously why of course you can he looked around him wildly as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of his hand im going to fix everything just the way it was before he said nodding determinedly shell see he talked a lot about the past and i gathered that he wanted to recover something some idea of himself perhaps that had gone into loving daisy his life had been confused and disordered since then but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly he could find out what that thing was one autumn night five years before they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight they stopped here and turned toward each other now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year the quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars out of the corner of his eye gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the treeshe could climb to it if he climbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap of life gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder his heart beat faster as daisys white face came up to his own he knew that when he kissed this girl and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath his mind would never romp again like the mind of god so he waited listening for a moment longer to the tuningfork that had been struck upon a star then he kissed her at his lips touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete through all he said even through his appalling sentimentality i was reminded of somethingan elusive rhythm a fragment of lost words that i had heard somewhere a long time ago for a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb mans as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air but they made no sound and what i had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever vii it was when curiosity about gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one saturday nightand as obscurely as it had begun his career as trimalchio was over only gradually did i become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away wondering if he were sick i went over to find outan unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door is mr gatsby sick nope after a pause he added sir in a dilatory grudging way i hadnt seen him around and i was rather worried tell him mr carraway came over who he demanded rudely carraway carraway all right ill tell him abruptly he slammed the door my finn informed me that gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others who never went into west egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone the grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the village was that the new people werent servants at all next day gatsby called me on the phone going away i inquired no old sport i hear you fired all your servants i wanted somebody who wouldnt gossip daisy comes over quite oftenin the afternoons so the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes theyre some people wolfshiem wanted to do something for theyre all brothers and sisters they used to run a small hotel i see he was calling up at daisys requestwould i come to lunch at her house tomorrow miss baker would be there half an hour later daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that i was coming something was up and yet i couldnt believe that they would choose this occasion for a sceneespecially for the rather harrowing scene that gatsby had outlined in the garden the next day was broiling almost the last certainly the warmest of the summer as my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the national biscuit company broke the simmering hush at noon the straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampened under her fingers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry her pocketbook slapped to the floor oh my she gasped i picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her holding it at arms length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that i had no designs upon itbut everyone near by including the woman suspected me just the same hot said the conductor to familiar faces some weather hot hot hot is it hot enough for you is it hot is it my commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand that anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart through the hall of the buchanans house blew a faint wind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to gatsby and me as we waited at the door the masters body roared the butler into the mouthpiece im sorry madame but we cant furnish itits far too hot to touch this noon what he really said was yes yes ill see he set down the receiver and came toward us glistening slightly to take our stiff straw hats madame expects you in the salon he cried needlessly indicating the direction in this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life the room shadowed well with awnings was dark and cool daisy and jordan lay upon an enormous couch like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans we cant move they said together jordans fingers powdered white over their tan rested for a moment in mine and mr thomas buchanan the athlete i inquired simultaneously i heard his voice gruff muffled husky at the hall telephone gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes daisy watched him and laughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air the rumour is whispered jordan that thats toms girl on the telephone we were silent the voice in the hall rose high with annoyance very well then i wont sell you the car at all im under no obligations to you at all and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time i wont stand that at all holding down the receiver said daisy cynically no hes not i assured her its a bonafide deal i happen to know about it tom flung open the door blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body and hurried into the room mr gatsby he put out his broad flat hand with wellconcealed dislike im glad to see you sir nick make us a cold drink cried daisy as he left the room again she got up and went over to gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth you know i love you she murmured you forget theres a lady present said jordan daisy looked around doubtfully you kiss nick too what a low vulgar girl i dont care cried daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room blessed precious she crooned holding out her arms come to your own mother that loves you the child relinquished by the nurse rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mothers dress the blessed precious did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair stand up now and sayhowdedo gatsby and i in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise i dont think he had ever really believed in its existence before i got dressed before luncheon said the child turning eagerly to daisy thats because your mother wanted to show you off her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck you dream you you absolute little dream yes admitted the child calmly aunt jordans got on a white dress too how do you like mothers friends daisy turned her around so that she faced gatsby do you think theyre pretty wheres daddy she doesnt look like her father explained daisy she looks like me shes got my hair and shape of the face daisy sat back upon the couch the nurse took a step forward and held out her hand come pammy goodbye sweetheart with a reluctant backward glance the welldisciplined child held to her nurses hand and was pulled out the door just as tom came back preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice gatsby took up his drink they certainly look cool he said with visible tension we drank in long greedy swallows i read somewhere that the suns getting hotter every year said tom genially it seems that pretty soon the earths going to fall into the sunor wait a minuteits just the oppositethe suns getting colder every year come outside he suggested to gatsby id like you to have a look at the place i went with them out to the veranda on the green sound stagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea gatsbys eyes followed it momentarily he raised his hand and pointed across the bay im right across from you so you are our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dogdays alongshore slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles theres sport for you said tom nodding id like to be out there with him for about an hour we had luncheon in the diningroom darkened too against the heat and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale whatll we do with ourselves this afternoon cried daisy and the day after that and the next thirty years dont be morbid jordan said life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall but its so hot insisted daisy on the verge of tears and everythings so confused lets all go to town her voice struggled on through the heat beating against it moulding its senselessness into forms ive heard of making a garage out of a stable tom was saying to gatsby but im the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage who wants to go to town demanded daisy insistently gatsbys eyes floated toward her ah she cried you look so cool their eyes met and they stared together at each other alone in space with an effort she glanced down at the table you always look so cool she repeated she had told him that she loved him and tom buchanan saw he was astounded his mouth opened a little and he looked at gatsby and then back at daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago you resemble the advertisement of the man she went on innocently you know the advertisement of the man all right broke in tom quickly im perfectly willing to go to town come onwere all going to town he got up his eyes still flashing between gatsby and his wife no one moved come on his temper cracked a little whats the matter anyhow if were going to town lets start his hand trembling with his effort at selfcontrol bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale daisys voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive are we just going to go she objected like this arent we going to let anyone smoke a cigarette first everybody smoked all through lunch oh lets have fun she begged him its too hot to fuss he didnt answer have it your own way she said come on jordan they went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet a silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky gatsby started to speak changed his mind but not before tom wheeled and faced him expectantly have you got your stables here asked gatsby with an effort about a quarter of a mile down the road oh a pause i dont see the idea of going to town broke out tom savagely women get these notions in their heads shall we take anything to drink called daisy from an upper window ill get some whisky answered tom he went inside gatsby turned to me rigidly i cant say anything in his house old sport shes got an indiscreet voice i remarked its full of i hesitated her voice is full of money he said suddenly that was it id never understood before it was full of moneythat was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it the jingle of it the cymbals song of it high in a white palace the kings daughter the golden girl tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel followed by daisy and jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms shall we all go in my car suggested gatsby he felt the hot green leather of the seat i ought to have left it in the shade is it standard shift demanded tom yes well you take my coup and let me drive your car to town the suggestion was distasteful to gatsby i dont think theres much gas he objected plenty of gas said tom boisterously he looked at the gauge and if it runs out i can stop at a drugstore you can buy anything at a drugstore nowadays a pause followed this apparently pointless remark daisy looked at tom frowning and an indefinable expression at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as if i had only heard it described in words passed over gatsbys face come on daisy said tom pressing her with his hand toward gatsbys car ill take you in this circus wagon he opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm you take nick and jordan well follow you in the coup she walked close to gatsby touching his coat with her hand jordan and tom and i got into the front seat of gatsbys car tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind did you see that demanded tom see what he looked at me keenly realizing that jordan and i must have known all along you think im pretty dumb dont you he suggested perhaps i am but i have aalmost a second sight sometimes that tells me what to do maybe you dont believe that but science he paused the immediate contingency overtook him pulled him back from the edge of theoretical abyss ive made a small investigation of this fellow he continued i could have gone deeper if id known do you mean youve been to a medium inquired jordan humorously what confused he stared at us as we laughed a medium about gatsby about gatsby no i havent i said id been making a small investigation of his past and you found he was an oxford man said jordan helpfully an oxford man he was incredulous like hell he is he wears a pink suit nevertheless hes an oxford man oxford new mexico snorted tom contemptuously or something like that listen tom if youre such a snob why did you invite him to lunch demanded jordan crossly daisy invited him she knew him before we were marriedgod knows where we were all irritable now with the fading ale and aware of it we drove for a while in silence then as doctor t j eckleburgs faded eyes came into sight down the road i remembered gatsbys caution about gasoline weve got enough to get us to town said tom but theres a garage right here objected jordan i dont want to get stalled in this baking heat tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under wilsons sign after a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed holloweyed at the car lets have some gas cried tom roughly what do you think we stopped forto admire the view im sick said wilson without moving been sick all day whats the matter im all run down well shall i help myself tom demanded you sounded well enough on the phone with an effort wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of the tank in the sunlight his face was green i didnt mean to interrupt your lunch he said but i need money pretty bad and i was wondering what you were going to do with your old car how do you like this one inquired tom i bought it last week its a nice yellow one said wilson as he strained at the handle like to buy it big chance wilson smiled faintly no but i could make some money on the other what do you want money for all of a sudden ive been here too long i want to get away my wife and i want to go west your wife does exclaimed tom startled shes been talking about it for ten years he rested for a moment against the pump shading his eyes and now shes going whether she wants to or not im going to get her away the coup flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand what do i owe you demanded tom harshly i just got wised up to something funny the last two days remarked wilson thats why i want to get away thats why i been bothering you about the car what do i owe you dollar twenty the relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and i had a bad moment there before i realized that so far his suspicions hadnt alighted on tom he had discovered that myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick i stared at him and then at tom who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour beforeand it occurred to me that there was no difference between men in intelligence or race so profound as the difference between the sick and the well wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivably guiltyas if he had just got some poor girl with child ill let you have that car said tom ill send it over tomorrow afternoon that locality was always vaguely disquieting even in the broad glare of afternoon and now i turned my head as though i had been warned of something behind over the ashheaps the giant eyes of doctor t j eckleburg kept their vigil but i perceived after a moment that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away in one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture her expression was curiously familiarit was an expression i had often seen on womens faces but on myrtle wilsons face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fixed not on tom but on jordan baker whom she took to be his wife there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic his wife and his mistress until an hour ago secure and inviolate were slipping precipitately from his control instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking daisy and leaving wilson behind and we sped along toward astoria at fifty miles an hour until among the spidery girders of the elevated we came in sight of the easygoing blue coup those big movies around fiftieth street are cool suggested jordan i love new york on summer afternoons when everyones away theres something very sensuous about itoverripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands the word sensuous had the effect of further disquieting tom but before he could invent a protest the coup came to a stop and daisy signalled us to draw up alongside where are we going she cried how about the movies its so hot she complained you go well ride around and meet you after with an effort her wit rose faintly well meet you on some corner ill be the man smoking two cigarettes we cant argue about it here tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us you follow me to the south side of central park in front of the plaza several times he turned his head and looked back for their car and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight i think he was afraid they would dart down a sidestreet and out of his life forever but they didnt and we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the plaza hotel the prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me though i have a sharp physical memory that in the course of it my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back the notion originated with daisys suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed more tangible form as a place to have a mint julep each of us said over and over that it was a crazy ideawe all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought or pretended to think that we were being very funny the room was large and stifling and though it was already four oclock opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the park daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us fixing her hair its a swell suite whispered jordan respectfully and everyone laughed open another window commanded daisy without turning around there arent any more well wed better telephone for an axe the thing to do is to forget about the heat said tom impatiently you make it ten times worse by crabbing about it he unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table why not let her alone old sport remarked gatsby youre the one that wanted to come to town there was a moment of silence the telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor whereupon jordan whispered excuse mebut this time no one laughed ill pick it up i offered ive got it gatsby examined the parted string muttered hum in an interested way and tossed the book on a chair thats a great expression of yours isnt it said tom sharply what is all this old sport business whered you pick that up now see here tom said daisy turning around from the mirror if youre going to make personal remarks i wont stay here a minute call up and order some ice for the mint julep as tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of mendelssohns wedding march from the ballroom below imagine marrying anybody in this heat cried jordan dismally stilli was married in the middle of june daisy remembered louisville in june somebody fainted who was it fainted tom biloxi he answered shortly a man named biloxi blocks biloxi and he made boxesthats a factand he was from biloxi tennessee they carried him into my house appended jordan because we lived just two doors from the church and he stayed three weeks until daddy told him he had to get out the day after he left daddy died after a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent there wasnt any connection i used to know a bill biloxi from memphis i remarked that was his cousin i knew his whole family history before he left he gave me an aluminium putter that i use today the music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window followed by intermittent cries of yeaeaea and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began were getting old said daisy if we were young wed rise and dance remember biloxi jordan warned her whered you know him tom biloxi he concentrated with an effort i didnt know him he was a friend of daisys he was not she denied id never seen him before he came down in the private car well he said he knew you he said he was raised in louisville asa bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him jordan smiled he was probably bumming his way home he told me he was president of your class at yale tom and i looked at each other blankly biloxi first place we didnt have any president gatsbys foot beat a short restless tattoo and tom eyed him suddenly by the way mr gatsby i understand youre an oxford man not exactly oh yes i understand you went to oxford yesi went there a pause then toms voice incredulous and insulting you must have gone there about the time biloxi went to new haven another pause a waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his thank you and the soft closing of the door this tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last i told you i went there said gatsby i heard you but id like to know when it was in nineteennineteen i only stayed five months thats why i cant really call myself an oxford man tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief but we were all looking at gatsby it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice he continued we could go to any of the universities in england or france i wanted to get up and slap him on the back i had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that id experienced before daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table open the whisky tom she ordered and ill make you a mint julep then you wont seem so stupid to yourself look at the mint wait a minute snapped tom i want to ask mr gatsby one more question go on gatsby said politely what kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow they were out in the open at last and gatsby was content he isnt causing a row daisy looked desperately from one to the other youre causing a row please have a little selfcontrol selfcontrol repeated tom incredulously i suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let mr nobody from nowhere make love to your wife well if thats the idea you can count me out nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next theyll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization were all white here murmured jordan i know im not very popular i dont give big parties i suppose youve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friendsin the modern world angry as i was as we all were i was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth the transition from libertine to prig was so complete ive got something to tell you old sport began gatsby but daisy guessed at his intention please dont she interrupted helplessly please lets all go home why dont we all go home thats a good idea i got up come on tom nobody wants a drink i want to know what mr gatsby has to tell me your wife doesnt love you said gatsby shes never loved you she loves me you must be crazy exclaimed tom automatically gatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement she never loved you do you hear he cried she only married you because i was poor and she was tired of waiting for me it was a terrible mistake but in her heart she never loved anyone except me at this point jordan and i tried to go but tom and gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remainas though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions sit down daisy toms voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note whats been going on i want to hear all about it i told you whats been going on said gatsby going on for five yearsand you didnt know tom turned to daisy sharply youve been seeing this fellow for five years not seeing said gatsby no we couldnt meet but both of us loved each other all that time old sport and you didnt know i used to laugh sometimesbut there was no laughter in his eyesto think that you didnt know ohthats all tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair youre crazy he exploded i cant speak about what happened five years ago because i didnt know daisy thenand ill be damned if i see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door but all the rest of thats a god damned lie daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now no said gatsby shaking his head she does though the trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesnt know what shes doing he nodded sagely and whats more i love daisy too once in a while i go off on a spree and make a fool of myself but i always come back and in my heart i love her all the time youre revolting said daisy she turned to me and her voice dropping an octave lower filled the room with thrilling scorn do you know why we left chicago im surprised that they didnt treat you to the story of that little spree gatsby walked over and stood beside her daisy thats all over now he said earnestly it doesnt matter any more just tell him the truththat you never loved himand its all wiped out forever she looked at him blindly whyhow could i love himpossibly you never loved him she hesitated her eyes fell on jordan and me with a sort of appeal as though she realized at last what she was doingand as though she had never all along intended doing anything at all but it was done now it was too late i never loved him she said with perceptible reluctance not at kapiolani demanded tom suddenly no from the ballroom beneath muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air not that day i carried you down from the punch bowl to keep your shoes dry there was a husky tenderness in his tone daisy please dont her voice was cold but the rancour was gone from it she looked at gatsby there jay she saidbut her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet oh you want too much she cried to gatsby i love you nowisnt that enough i cant help whats past she began to sob helplessly i did love him oncebut i loved you too gatsbys eyes opened and closed you loved me too he repeated even thats a lie said tom savagely she didnt know you were alive whytheres things between daisy and me that youll never know things that neither of us can ever forget the words seemed to bite physically into gatsby i want to speak to daisy alone he insisted shes all excited now even alone i cant say i never loved tom she admitted in a pitiful voice it wouldnt be true of course it wouldnt agreed tom she turned to her husband as if it mattered to you she said of course it matters im going to take better care of you from now on you dont understand said gatsby with a touch of panic youre not going to take care of her any more im not tom opened his eyes wide and laughed he could afford to control himself now whys that daisys leaving you nonsense i am though she said with a visible effort shes not leaving me toms words suddenly leaned down over gatsby certainly not for a common swindler whod have to steal the ring he put on her finger i wont stand this cried daisy oh please lets get out who are you anyhow broke out tom youre one of that bunch that hangs around with meyer wolfshiemthat much i happen to know ive made a little investigation into your affairsand ill carry it further tomorrow you can suit yourself about that old sport said gatsby steadily i found out what your drugstores were he turned to us and spoke rapidly he and this wolfshiem bought up a lot of sidestreet drugstores here and in chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter thats one of his little stunts i picked him for a bootlegger the first time i saw him and i wasnt far wrong what about it said gatsby politely i guess your friend walter chase wasnt too proud to come in on it and you left him in the lurch didnt you you let him go to jail for a month over in new jersey god you ought to hear walter on the subject of you he came to us dead broke he was very glad to pick up some money old sport dont you call me old sport cried tom gatsby said nothing walter could have you up on the betting laws too but wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth that unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in gatsbys face that drugstore business was just small change continued tom slowly but youve got something on now that walters afraid to tell me about i glanced at daisy who was staring terrified between gatsby and her husband and at jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin then i turned back to gatsbyand was startled at his expression he lookedand this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his gardenas if he had killed a man for a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way it passed and he began to talk excitedly to daisy denying everything defending his name against accusations that had not been made but with every word she was drawing further and further into herself so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away trying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling unhappily undespairingly toward that lost voice across the room the voice begged again to go please tom i cant stand this any more her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions whatever courage she had had were definitely gone you two start on home daisy said tom in mr gatsbys car she looked at tom alarmed now but he insisted with magnanimous scorn go on he wont annoy you i think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over they were gone without a word snapped out made accidental isolated like ghosts even from our pity after a moment tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whisky in the towel want any of this stuff jordan nick i didnt answer nick he asked again what want any no i just remembered that todays my birthday i was thirty before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade it was seven oclock when we got into the coup with him and started for long island tom talked incessantly exulting and laughing but his voice was as remote from jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind thirtythe promise of a decade of loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm thinning hair but there was jordan beside me who unlike daisy was too wise ever to carry wellforgotten dreams from age to age as we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coats shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand so we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight the young greek michaelis who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest he had slept through the heat until after five when he strolled over to the garage and found george wilson sick in his officereally sick pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over michaelis advised him to go to bed but wilson refused saying that hed miss a lot of business if he did while his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead ive got my wife locked in up there explained wilson calmly shes going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then were going to move away michaelis was astonished they had been neighbours for four years and wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement generally he was one of these wornout men when he wasnt working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road when anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable colourless way he was his wifes man and not his own so naturally michaelis tried to find out what had happened but wilson wouldnt say a wordinstead he began to throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what hed been doing at certain times on certain days just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and michaelis took the opportunity to get away intending to come back later but he didnt he supposed he forgot to thats all when he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard mrs wilsons voice loud and scolding downstairs in the garage beat me he heard her cry throw me down and beat me you dirty little coward a moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving her hands and shoutingbefore he could move from his door the business was over the death car as the newspapers called it didnt stop it came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend mavro michaelis wasnt even sure of its colourhe told the first policeman that it was light green the other car the one going toward new york came to rest a hundred yards beyond and its driver hurried back to where myrtle wilson her life violently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath the mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long we saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away wreck said tom thats good wilsonll have a little business at last he slowed down but still without any intention of stopping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes well take a look he said doubtfully just a look i became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we got out of the coup and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words oh my god uttered over and over in a gasping moan theres some bad trouble here said tom excitedly he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through the circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation it was a minute before i could see anything at all then new arrivals deranged the line and jordan and i were pushed suddenly inside myrtle wilsons body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a worktable by the wall and tom with his back to us was bending over it motionless next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book at first i couldnt find the source of the high groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garagethen i saw wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder but wilson neither heard nor saw his eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call oh my gaod oh my gaod oh gaod oh my gaod presently tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman mav the policeman was saying o no r corrected the man mavro listen to me muttered tom fiercely r said the policeman o g g he looked up as toms broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder what you want fella what happenedthats what i want to know auto hit her insantly killed instantly killed repeated tom staring she ran out ina road sonofabitch didnt even stopus car there was two cars said michaelis one comin one goin see going where asked the policeman keenly one goin each way well shehis hand rose toward the blankets but stopped halfway and fell to his sideshe ran out there an the one comin from nyork knock right into her goin thirty or forty miles an hour whats the name of this place here demanded the officer hasnt got any name a pale welldressed negro stepped near it was a yellow car he said big yellow car new see the accident asked the policeman no but the car passed me down the road going fastern forty going fifty sixty come here and lets have your name look out now i want to get his name some words of this conversation must have reached wilson swaying in the office door for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries you dont have to tell me what kind of car it was i know what kind of car it was watching tom i saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat he walked quickly over to wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms youve got to pull yourself together he said with soothing gruffness wilsons eyes fell upon tom he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not tom held him upright listen said tom shaking him a little i just got here a minute ago from new york i was bringing you that coup weve been talking about that yellow car i was driving this afternoon wasnt minedo you hear i havent seen it all afternoon only the negro and i were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes whats all that he demanded im a friend of his tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on wilsons body he says he knows the car that did it it was a yellow car some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at tom and what colours your car its a blue car a coup weve come straight from new york i said someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away now if youll let me have that name again correct picking up wilson like a doll tom carried him into the office set him down in a chair and came back if somebodyll come here and sit with him he snapped authoritatively he watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room then tom shut the door on them and came down the single step his eyes avoiding the table as he passed close to me he whispered lets get out selfconsciously with his authoritative arms breaking the way we pushed through the still gathering crowd passing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bendthen his foot came down hard and the coup raced along through the night in a little while i heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face the god damned coward he whimpered he didnt even stop his car the buchanans house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines daisys home he said as we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly i ought to have dropped you in west egg nick theres nothing we can do tonight a change had come over him and he spoke gravely and with decision as we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases ill telephone for a taxi to take you home and while youre waiting you and jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supperif you want any he opened the door come in no thanks but id be glad if youd order me the taxi ill wait outside jordan put her hand on my arm wont you come in nick no thanks i was feeling a little sick and i wanted to be alone but jordan lingered for a moment more its only halfpast nine she said id be damned if id go in id had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included jordan too she must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house i sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands until i heard the phone taken up inside and the butlers voice calling a taxi then i walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate i hadnt gone twenty yards when i heard my name and gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path i must have felt pretty weird by that time because i could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon what are you doing i inquired just standing here old sport somehow that seemed a despicable occupation for all i knew he was going to rob the house in a moment i wouldnt have been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of wolfshiems people behind him in the dark shrubbery did you see any trouble on the road he asked after a minute yes he hesitated was she killed yes i thought so i told daisy i thought so its better that the shock should all come at once she stood it pretty well he spoke as if daisys reaction was the only thing that mattered i got to west egg by a side road he went on and left the car in my garage i dont think anybody saw us but of course i cant be sure i disliked him so much by this time that i didnt find it necessary to tell him he was wrong who was the woman he inquired her name was wilson her husband owns the garage how the devil did it happen well i tried to swing the wheel he broke off and suddenly i guessed at the truth was daisy driving yes he said after a moment but of course ill say i was you see when we left new york she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to driveand this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way it all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebody she knew well first daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car and then she lost her nerve and turned back the second my hand reached the wheel i felt the shockit must have killed her instantly it ripped her open dont tell me old sport he winced anyhowdaisy stepped on it i tried to make her stop but she couldnt so i pulled on the emergency brake then she fell over into my lap and i drove on shell be all right tomorrow he said presently im just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon shes locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality shes going to turn the light out and on again he wont touch her i said hes not thinking about her i dont trust him old sport how long are you going to wait all night if necessary anyhow till they all go to bed a new point of view occurred to me suppose tom found out that daisy had been driving he might think he saw a connection in ithe might think anything i looked at the house there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from daisys room on the ground floor you wait here i said ill see if theres any sign of a commotion i walked back along the border of the lawn traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps the drawingroom curtains were open and i saw that the room was empty crossing the porch where we had dined that june night three months before i came to a small rectangle of light which i guessed was the pantry window the blind was drawn but i found a rift at the sill daisy and tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale he was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement they werent happy and neither of them had touched the chicken or the aleand yet they werent unhappy either there was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together as i tiptoed from the porch i heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house gatsby was waiting where i had left him in the drive is it all quiet up there he asked anxiously yes its all quiet i hesitated youd better come home and get some sleep he shook his head i want to wait here till daisy goes to bed good night old sport he put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil so i walked away and left him standing there in the moonlightwatching over nothing viii i couldnt sleep all night a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the sound and i tossed halfsick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams toward dawn i heard a taxi go up gatsbys drive and immediately i jumped out of bed and began to dressi felt that i had something to tell him something to warn him about and morning would be too late crossing his lawn i saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy with dejection or sleep nothing happened he said wanly i waited and about four oclock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light his house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes we pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switchesonce i tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano there was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadnt been aired for many days i found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside throwing open the french windows of the drawingroom we sat smoking out into the darkness you ought to go away i said its pretty certain theyll trace your car go away now old sport go to atlantic city for a week or up to montreal he wouldnt consider it he couldnt possibly leave daisy until he knew what she was going to do he was clutching at some last hope and i couldnt bear to shake him free it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with dan codytold it to me because jay gatsby had broken up like glass against toms hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out i think that he would have acknowledged anything now without reserve but he wanted to talk about daisy she was the first nice girl he had ever known in various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between he found her excitingly desirable he went to her house at first with other officers from camp taylor then alone it amazed himhe had never been in such a beautiful house before but what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that daisy lived thereit was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him there was a ripe mystery about it a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this years shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered it excited him too that many men had already loved daisyit increased her value in his eyes he felt their presence all about the house pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions but he knew that he was in daisys house by a colossal accident however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby he was at present a penniless young man without a past and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders so he made the most of his time he took what he could get ravenously and unscrupulouslyeventually he took daisy one still october night took her because he had no real right to touch her hand he might have despised himself for he had certainly taken her under false pretences i dont mean that he had traded on his phantom millions but he had deliberately given daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herselfthat he was fully able to take care of her as a matter of fact he had no such facilitieshe had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world but he didnt despise himself and it didnt turn out as he had imagined he had intended probably to take what he could and gobut now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail he knew that daisy was extraordinary but he didnt realize just how extraordinary a nice girl could be she vanished into her rich house into her rich full life leaving gatsbynothing he felt married to her that was all when they met again two days later it was gatsby who was breathless who was somehow betrayed her porch was bright with the bought luxury of starshine the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth she had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves of the freshness of many clothes and of daisy gleaming like silver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor i cant describe to you how surprised i was to find out i loved her old sport i even hoped for a while that shed throw me over but she didnt because she was in love with me too she thought i knew a lot because i knew different things from her well there i was way off my ambitions getting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden i didnt care what was the use of doing great things if i could have a better time telling her what i was going to do on the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with daisy in his arms for a long silent time it was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair the afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised they had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coats shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers gently as though she were asleep he did extraordinarily well in the war he was a captain before he went to the front and following the argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machineguns after the armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to oxford instead he was worried nowthere was a quality of nervous despair in daisys letters she didnt see why he couldnt come she was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all for daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes all night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the beale street blues while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust at the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor through this twilight universe daisy began to move again with the season suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an eveningdress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed and all the time something within her was crying for a decision she wanted her life shaped now immediatelyand the decision must be made by some forceof love of money of unquestionable practicalitythat was close at hand that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom buchanan there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and daisy was flattered doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief the letter reached gatsby while he was still at oxford it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs filling the house with greyturning goldturning light the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves there was a slow pleasant movement in the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day i dont think she ever loved him gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly you must remember old sport she was very excited this afternoon he told her those things in a way that frightened herthat made it look as if i was some kind of cheap sharper and the result was she hardly knew what she was saying he sat down gloomily of course she might have loved him just for a minute when they were first marriedand loved me more even then do you see suddenly he came out with a curious remark in any case he said it was just personal what could you make of that except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldnt be measured he came back from france when tom and daisy were still on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irresistible journey to louisville on the last of his army pay he stayed there a week walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the november night and revisiting the outoftheway places to which they had driven in her white car just as daisys house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself even though she was gone from it was pervaded with a melancholy beauty he left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found herthat he was leaving her behind the daycoachhe was penniless nowwas hot he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a foldingchair and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by then out into the spring fields where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street the track curved and now it was going away from the sun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath he stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him but it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it the freshest and the best forever it was nine oclock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch the night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air the gardener the last one of gatsbys former servants came to the foot of the steps im going to drain the pool today mr gatsby leavesll start falling pretty soon and then theres always trouble with the pipes dont do it today gatsby answered he turned to me apologetically you know old sport ive never used that pool all summer i looked at my watch and stood up twelve minutes to my train i didnt want to go to the city i wasnt worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than thati didnt want to leave gatsby i missed that train and then another before i could get myself away ill call you up i said finally do old sport ill call you about noon we walked slowly down the steps i suppose daisyll call too he looked at me anxiously as if he hoped id corroborate this i suppose so well goodbye we shook hands and i started away just before i reached the hedge i remembered something and turned around theyre a rotten crowd i shouted across the lawn youre worth the whole damn bunch put together ive always been glad i said that it was the only compliment i ever gave him because i disapproved of him from beginning to end first he nodded politely and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile as if wed been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time his gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps and i thought of the night when i first came to his ancestral home three months before the lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruptionand he had stood on those steps concealing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbye i thanked him for his hospitality we were always thanking him for thati and the others goodbye i called i enjoyed breakfast gatsby up in the city i tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock then i fell asleep in my swivelchair just before noon the phone woke me and i started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead it was jordan baker she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golflinks had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry ive left daisys house she said im at hempstead and im going down to southampton this afternoon probably it had been tactful to leave daisys house but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid you werent so nice to me last night how could it have mattered then silence for a moment then howeveri want to see you i want to see you too suppose i dont go to southampton and come into town this afternoon noi dont think this afternoon very well its impossible this afternoon various we talked like that for a while and then abruptly we werent talking any longer i dont know which of us hung up with a sharp click but i know i didnt care i couldnt have talked to her across a teatable that day if i never talked to her again in this world i called gatsbys house a few minutes later but the line was busy i tried four times finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from detroit taking out my timetable i drew a small circle around the threefifty train then i leaned back in my chair and tried to think it was just noon when i passed the ashheaps on the train that morning i had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car i supposed thered be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and myrtle wilsons tragic achievement was forgotten now i want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before they had difficulty in locating the sister catherine she must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to flushing when they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sisters body until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while george wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside for a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door michaelis and several other men were with him first four or five men later two or three men still later michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee after that he stayed there alone with wilson until dawn about three oclock the quality of wilsons incoherent muttering changedhe grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car he announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen but when he heard himself say this he flinched and began to cry oh my god again in his groaning voice michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him how long have you been married george come on there try and sit still a minute and answer my question how long have you been married twelve years ever had any children come on george sit stilli asked you a question did you ever have any children the hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadnt stopped a few hours before he didnt like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the officehe knew every object in it before morningand from time to time sat down beside wilson trying to keep him more quiet have you got a church you go to sometimes george maybe even if you havent been there for a long time maybe i could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you see dont belong to any you ought to have a church george for times like this you must have gone to church once didnt you get married in a church listen george listen to me didnt you get married in a church that was a long time ago the effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rockingfor a moment he was silent then the same halfknowing halfbewildered look came back into his faded eyes look in the drawer there he said pointing at the desk which drawer that drawerthat one michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand there was nothing in it but a small expensive dogleash made of leather and braided silver it was apparently new this he inquired holding it up wilson stared and nodded i found it yesterday afternoon she tried to tell me about it but i knew it was something funny you mean your wife bought it she had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau michaelis didnt see anything odd in that and he gave wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dogleash but conceivably wilson had heard some of these same explanations before from myrtle because he began saying oh my god again in a whisperhis comforter left several explanations in the air then he killed her said wilson his mouth dropped open suddenly who did i have a way of finding out youre morbid george said his friend this has been a strain to you and you dont know what youre saying youd better try and sit quiet till morning he murdered her it was an accident george wilson shook his head his eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior hm i know he said definitely im one of these trusting fellas and i dont think any harm to nobody but when i get to know a thing i know it it was the man in that car she ran out to speak to him and he wouldnt stop michaelis had seen this too but it hadnt occurred to him that there was any special significance in it he believed that mrs wilson had been running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any particular car how could she of been like that shes a deep one said wilson as if that answered the question ahhh he began to rock again and michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand maybe you got some friend that i could telephone for george this was a forlorn hopehe was almost sure that wilson had no friend there was not enough of him for his wife he was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room a blue quickening by the window and realized that dawn wasnt far off about five oclock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light wilsons glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind i spoke to her he muttered after a long silence i told her she might fool me but she couldnt fool god i took her to the windowwith an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against itand i said god knows what youve been doing everything youve been doing you may fool me but you cant fool god standing behind him michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of doctor t j eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night god sees everything repeated wilson thats an advertisement michaelis assured him something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room but wilson stood there a long time his face close to the window pane nodding into the twilight by six oclock michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside it was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together wilson was quieter now and michaelis went home to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage wilson was gone his movementshe was on foot all the timewere afterward traced to port roosevelt and then to gads hill where he bought a sandwich that he didnt eat and a cup of coffee he must have been tired and walking slowly for he didnt reach gads hill until noon thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his timethere were boys who had seen a man acting sort of crazy and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road then for three hours he disappeared from view the police on the strength of what he said to michaelis that he had a way of finding out supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout inquiring for a yellow car on the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of finding out what he wanted to know by halfpast two he was in west egg where he asked someone the way to gatsbys house so by that time he knew gatsbys name at two oclock gatsby put on his bathingsuit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool he stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up then he gave instructions that the open car wasnt to be taken out under any circumstancesand this was strange because the front right fender needed repair gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool once he stopped and shifted it a little and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees no telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four oclockuntil long after there was anyone to give it to if it came i have an idea that gatsby himself didnt believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared if that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world paid a high price for living too long with a single dream he must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass a new world material without being real where poor ghosts breathing dreams like air drifted fortuitously about like that ashen fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees the chauffeurhe was one of wolfshiems protgsheard the shotsafterwards he could only say that he hadnt thought anything much about them i drove from the station directly to gatsbys house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone but they knew then i firmly believe with scarcely a word said four of us the chauffeur butler gardener and i hurried down to the pool there was a faint barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other with little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool a small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden the touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly tracing like the leg of transit a thin red circle in the water it was after we started with gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw wilsons body a little way off in the grass and the holocaust was complete ix after two years i remember the rest of that day and that night and the next day only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of gatsbys front door a rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered openmouthed about the pool someone with a positive manner perhaps a detective used the expression madman as he bent over wilsons body that afternoon and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning most of those reports were a nightmaregrotesque circumstantial eager and untrue when michaeliss testimony at the inquest brought to light wilsons suspicions of his wife i thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinadebut catherine who might have said anything didnt say a word she showed a surprising amount of character about it toolooked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen gatsby that her sister was completely happy with her husband that her sister had been into no mischief whatever she convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure so wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief in order that the case might remain in its simplest form and it rested there but all this part of it seemed remote and unessential i found myself on gatsbys side and alone from the moment i telephoned news of the catastrophe to west egg village every surmise about him and every practical question was referred to me at first i was surprised and confused then as he lay in his house and didnt move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that i was responsible because no one else was interestedinterested i mean with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end i called up daisy half an hour after we found him called her instinctively and without hesitation but she and tom had gone away early that afternoon and taken baggage with them left no address no say when theyd be back no any idea where they are how i could reach them i dont know cant say i wanted to get somebody for him i wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him ill get somebody for you gatsby dont worry just trust me and ill get somebody for you meyer wolfshiems name wasnt in the phone book the butler gave me his office address on broadway and i called information but by the time i had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone will you ring again ive rung three times its very important sorry im afraid no ones there i went back to the drawingroom and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors all these official people who suddenly filled it but though they drew back the sheet and looked at gatsby with shocked eyes his protest continued in my brain look here old sport youve got to get somebody for me youve got to try hard i cant go through this alone someone started to ask me questions but i broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his deskhed never told me definitely that his parents were dead but there was nothingonly the picture of dan cody a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall next morning i sent the butler to new york with a letter to wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train that request seemed superfluous when i wrote it i was sure hed start when he saw the newspapers just as i was sure thered be a wire from daisy before noonbut neither a wire nor mr wolfshiem arrived no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men when the butler brought back wolfshiems answer i began to have a feeling of defiance of scornful solidarity between gatsby and me against them all dear mr carraway this has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me i hardly can believe it that it is true at all such a mad act as that man did should make us all think i cannot come down now as i am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now if there is anything i can do a little later let me know in a letter by edgar i hardly know where i am when i hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out yours truly meyer wolfshiem and then hasty addenda beneath let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all when the phone rang that afternoon and long distance said chicago was calling i thought this would be daisy at last but the connection came through as a mans voice very thin and far away this is slagle speaking yes the name was unfamiliar hell of a note isnt it get my wire there havent been any wires young parkes in trouble he said rapidly they picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter they got a circular from new york giving em the numbers just five minutes before what dyou know about that hey you never can tell in these hick towns hello i interrupted breathlessly look herethis isnt mr gatsby mr gatsbys dead there was a long silence on the other end of the wire followed by an exclamation then a quick squawk as the connection was broken i think it was on the third day that a telegram signed henry c gatz arrived from a town in minnesota it said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came it was gatsbys father a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm september day his eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when i took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that i had difficulty in getting off his coat he was on the point of collapse so i took him into the musicroom and made him sit down while i sent for something to eat but he wouldnt eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand i saw it in the chicago newspaper he said it was all in the chicago newspaper i started right away i didnt know how to reach you his eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about the room it was a madman he said he must have been mad wouldnt you like some coffee i urged him i dont want anything im all right now mr carraway well im all right now where have they got jimmy i took him into the drawingroom where his son lay and left him there some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall when i told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away after a little while mr gatz opened the door and came out his mouth ajar his face flushed slightly his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears he had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride i helped him to a bedroom upstairs while he took off his coat and vest i told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came i didnt know what youd want mr gatsby gatz is my name mr gatz i thought you might want to take the body west he shook his head jimmy always liked it better down east he rose up to his position in the east were you a friend of my boys mr we were close friends he had a big future before him you know he was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here he touched his head impressively and i nodded if hed of lived hed of been a great man a man like james j hill hed of helped build up the country thats true i said uncomfortably he fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take it from the bed and lay down stifflywas instantly asleep that night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who i was before he would give his name this is mr carraway i said oh he sounded relieved this is klipspringer i was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at gatsbys grave i didnt want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so id been calling up a few people myself they were hard to find the funerals tomorrow i said three oclock here at the house i wish youd tell anybody whod be interested oh i will he broke out hastily of course im not likely to see anybody but if i do his tone made me suspicious of course youll be there yourself well ill certainly try what i called up about is wait a minute i interrupted how about saying youll come well the fact isthe truth of the matter is that im staying with some people up here in greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow in fact theres a sort of picnic or something of course ill do my best to get away i ejaculated an unrestrained huh and he must have heard me for he went on nervously what i called up about was a pair of shoes i left there i wonder if itd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on you see theyre tennis shoes and im sort of helpless without them my address is care of b f i didnt hear the rest of the name because i hung up the receiver after that i felt a certain shame for gatsbyone gentleman to whom i telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved however that was my fault for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at gatsby on the courage of gatsbys liquor and i should have known better than to call him the morning of the funeral i went up to new york to see meyer wolfshiem i couldnt seem to reach him any other way the door that i pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked the swastika holding company and at first there didnt seem to be anyone inside but when id shouted hello several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes nobodys in she said mr wolfshiems gone to chicago the first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle the rosary tunelessly inside please say that mr carraway wants to see him i cant get him back from chicago can i at this moment a voice unmistakably wolfshiems called stella from the other side of the door leave your name on the desk she said quickly ill give it to him when he gets back but i know hes there she took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips you young men think you can force your way in here any time she scolded were getting sickantired of it when i say hes in chicago hes in chicago i mentioned gatsby ohh she looked at me over again will you justwhat was your name she vanished in a moment meyer wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway holding out both hands he drew me into his office remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us and offered me a cigar my memory goes back to when first i met him he said a young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war he was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldnt buy some regular clothes first time i saw him was when he came into winebrenners poolroom at fortythird street and asked for a job he hadnt eat anything for a couple of days come on have some lunch with me i said he ate more than four dollars worth of food in half an hour did you start him in business i inquired start him i made him oh i raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter i saw right away he was a fineappearing gentlemanly young man and when he told me he was at oggsford i knew i could use him good i got him to join the american legion and he used to stand high there right off he did some work for a client of mine up to albany we were so thick like that in everythinghe held up two bulbous fingersalways together i wondered if this partnership had included the worlds series transaction in 1919 now hes dead i said after a moment you were his closest friend so i know youll want to come to his funeral this afternoon id like to come well come then the hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears i cant do iti cant get mixed up in it he said theres nothing to get mixed up in its all over now when a man gets killed i never like to get mixed up in it in any way i keep out when i was a young man it was differentif a friend of mine died no matter how i stuck with them to the end you may think thats sentimental but i mean itto the bitter end i saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come so i stood up are you a college man he inquired suddenly for a moment i thought he was going to suggest a gonnegtion but he only nodded and shook my hand let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead he suggested after that my own rule is to let everything alone when i left his office the sky had turned dark and i got back to west egg in a drizzle after changing my clothes i went next door and found mr gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall his pride in his son and in his sons possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me jimmy sent me this picture he took out his wallet with trembling fingers look there it was a photograph of the house cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands he pointed out every detail to me eagerly look there and then sought admiration from my eyes he had shown it so often that i think it was more real to him now than the house itself jimmy sent it to me i think its a very pretty picture it shows up well very well had you seen him lately he come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house i live in now of course we was broke up when he run off from home but i see now there was a reason for it he knew he had a big future in front of him and ever since he made a success he was very generous with me he seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it for another minute lingeringly before my eyes then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called hopalong cassidy look here this is a book he had when he was a boy it just shows you he opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see on the last flyleaf was printed the word schedule and the date september 12 1906 and underneath rise from bed 600 am dumbell exercise and wallscaling 615630 study electricity etc 715815 work 830430 pm baseball

bath every other day read one improving book or magazine per week save 500 crossed out 300 per week be better to parents i came across this book by accident said the old man it just shows you dont it it just shows you jimmy was bound to get ahead he always had some resolves like this or something do you notice what hes got about improving his mind he was always great for that he told me i et like a hog once and i beat him for it he was reluctant to close the book reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me i think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use a little before three the lutheran minister arrived from flushing and i began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars so did gatsbys father and as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way the minister glanced several times at his watch so i took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour but it wasnt any use nobody came about five oclock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gatefirst a motor hearse horribly black and wet then mr gatz and the minister and me in the limousine and a little later four or five servants and the postman from west egg in gatsbys station wagon all wet to the skin as we started through the gate into the cemetery i heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground i looked around it was the man with owleyed glasses whom i had found marvelling over gatsbys books in the library one night three months before id never seen him since then i dont know how he knew about the funeral or even his name the rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from gatsbys grave i tried to think about gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and i could only remember without resentment that daisy hadnt sent a message or a flower dimly i heard someone murmur blessed are the dead that the rain falls on and then the owleyed man said amen to that in a brave voice we straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars owleyes spoke to me by the gate i couldnt get to the house he remarked neither could anybody else go on he started why my god they used to go there by the hundreds he took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in the poor sonofabitch he said one of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at christmas time those who went farther than chicago would gather in the old dim union station at six oclock of a december evening with a few chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gaieties to bid them a hasty goodbye i remember the fur coats of the girls returning from miss thisorthats and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations are you going to the ordways the herseys the schultzes and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands and last the murky yellow cars of the chicago milwaukee and st paul railroad looking cheerful as christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate when we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows and the dim lights of small wisconsin stations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air we drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again thats my middle westnot the wheat or the prairies or the lost swede towns but the thrilling returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow i am part of that a little solemn with the feel of those long winters a little complacent from growing up in the carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a familys name i see now that this has been a story of the west after alltom and gatsby daisy and jordan and i were all westerners and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to eastern life even when the east excited me most even when i was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawling swollen towns beyond the ohio with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very oldeven then it had always for me a quality of distortion west egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams i see it as a night scene by el greco a hundred houses at once conventional and grotesque crouching under a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon in the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress her hand which dangles over the side sparkles cold with jewels gravely the men turn in at a housethe wrong house but no one knows the womans name and no one cares after gatsbys death the east was haunted for me like that distorted beyond my eyes power of correction so when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line i decided to come back home there was one thing to be done before i left an awkward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone but i wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away i saw jordan baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair she was dressed to play golf and i remember thinking she looked like a good illustration her chin raised a little jauntily her hair the colour of an autumn leaf her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee when i had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man i doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but i pretended to be surprised for just a minute i wondered if i wasnt making a mistake then i thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye nevertheless you did throw me over said jordan suddenly you threw me over on the telephone i dont give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and i felt a little dizzy for a while we shook hands oh and do you remembershe addeda conversation we had once about driving a car whynot exactly you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver well i met another bad driver didnt i i mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess i thought you were rather an honest straightforward person i thought it was your secret pride im thirty i said im five years too old to lie to myself and call it honour she didnt answer angry and half in love with her and tremendously sorry i turned away one afternoon late in october i saw tom buchanan he was walking ahead of me along fifth avenue in his alert aggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference his head moving sharply here and there adapting itself to his restless eyes just as i slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand whats the matter nick do you object to shaking hands with me yes you know what i think of you youre crazy nick he said quickly crazy as hell i dont know whats the matter with you tom i inquired what did you say to wilson that afternoon he stared at me without a word and i knew i had guessed right about those missing hours i started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm i told him the truth he said he came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when i sent down word that we werent in he tried to force his way upstairs he was crazy enough to kill me if i hadnt told him who owned the car his hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house he broke off defiantly what if i did tell him that fellow had it coming to him he threw dust into your eyes just like he did in daisys but he was a tough one he ran over myrtle like youd run over a dog and never even stopped his car there was nothing i could say except the one unutterable fact that it wasnt true and if you think i didnt have my share of sufferinglook here when i went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard i sat down and cried like a baby by god it was awful i couldnt forgive him or like him but i saw that what he had done was to him entirely justified it was all very careless and confused they were careless people tom and daisythey smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made i shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for i felt suddenly as though i were talking to a child then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklaceor perhaps only a pair of cuff buttonsrid of my provincial squeamishness forever gatsbys house was still empty when i leftthe grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine one of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhaps it was he who drove daisy and gatsby over to east egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own i didnt want to hear it and i avoided him when i got off the train i spent my saturday nights in new york because those gleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that i could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive one night i did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps but i didnt investigate probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didnt know that the party was over on the last night with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer i went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more on the white steps an obscene word scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood out clearly in the moonlight and i erased it drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone then i wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow of a ferryboat across the sound and as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually i became aware of the old island here that flowered once for dutch sailors eyesa fresh green breast of the new world its vanished trees the trees that had made way for gatsbys house had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder and as i sat there brooding on the old unknown world i thought of gatsbys wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of daisys dock he had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it he did not know that it was already behind him somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night gatsby believed in the green light the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us it eluded us then but thats no mattertomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms further and one fine morning so we beat on boats against the current borne back

archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooksletter 1 to mrs saville england st petersburgh dec 11th 17 you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour therefor with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas library my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise i commenced by inuring my body to hardship i accompanied the whalefishers on several expeditions to the north sea i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage twice i actually hired myself as an undermate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path oh that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude i am required not only to raise the spirits of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in fursa dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins i have no ambition to lose my life on the postroad between st petersburgh and archangel i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whalefishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps years will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again soon or never farewell my dear excellent margaret heaven shower down blessings on you and save me that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness your affectionate brother r walton letter 2 to mrs saville england archangel 28th march 17 how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am selfeducated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twentyeight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want as the painters call it keeping and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his wellknown integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prizemoney the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prizemoney to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart i am going to unexplored regions to the land of mist and snow but i shall kill no albatross therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ancient mariner you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand i am practically industriouspainstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labourbut besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore but to return to dearer considerations shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits i love you very tenderly remember me with affection should you never hear from me again your affectionate brother robert walton letter 3 to mrs saville england july 7th 17 my dear sister i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safeand well advanced on my voyage this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years i am however in good spirits my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them we have already reached a very high latitude but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage adieu my dear margaret be assured that for my own sake as well as yours i will not rashly encounter danger i will be cool persevering and prudent but success shall crown my endeavours wherefore not thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus but i must finish heaven bless my beloved sister rw letter 4 to mrs saville england august 5th 17 so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear recording it although it is very probable that you will see me before these papers can come into your possession last monday july 31st we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she floated our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather about two oclock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed shut in however by ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with the greatest attention about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and before night the ice broke and freed our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice i profited of this time to rest for a few hours in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remained alive but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i appeared on deck the master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea on perceiving me the stranger addressed me in english although with a foreign accent before i come on board your vessel said he will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a condition we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied to seek one who fled from me and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion yes then i fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice this aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dmon as he called him had pursued soon after when he was alone with me he said i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people but you are too considerate to make inquiries certainly it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation you have benevolently restored me to life soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time but of this i could not judge from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should i have any fresh incidents to record august 13th 17 my affection for my guest increases every day he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief he is so gentle yet so wise his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers a groan burst from his heaving breast i paused at length he spoke in broken accents unhappy man do you share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally he asked me the history of my earlier years the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection i spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing i agree with you replied the stranger we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures i once had a friend the most noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecting friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but ii have lost everything and cannot begin life anew as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm settled grief that touched me to the heart but he was silent and presently retired to his cabin even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth such a man has a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but neverfailing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soulsubduing music august 19th 17 yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the evervaried powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lipswith what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his fulltoned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itthus chapter 1 i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life several months passed in this manner her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beauforts coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the latediscovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something bettertheir child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of selfcontrol i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passionremembering what she had suffered and how she had been relievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of halfclothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were darkeyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heavensent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italyone among the schiavi ognor frementi who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among darkleaved brambles when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cheruba creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents housemy more than sisterthe beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victortomorrow he shall have it and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as minemine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to memy more than sister since till death she was to be mine only chapter 2 we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summersshe found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my schoolfellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrinededicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clervalcould aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree selftaught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a childs blindness added to a students thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a wouldbe science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifethe last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard it was a strong effort of the spirit of good but it was ineffectual destiny was too potent and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction chapter 3 when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurredan omen as it were of my future misery elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemperelizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for everthat the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard these are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget the day of my departure at length arrived clerval spent the last evening with us he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrowminded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce we sat late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word farewell it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived but when at mornings dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all theremy father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alone in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar faces but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers such were my reflections as i commenced my journey but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge i had often when at home thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been folly to repent i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors chanceor rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my fathers doorled me first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy i replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied the professor stared have you he said really spent your time in studying such nonsense i replied in the affirmative every minute continued m krempe with warmth every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape m krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power such views although futile were grand but now the scene was changed the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m krempe had given me concerning the lectures and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor was very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms after having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget the ancient teachers of this science said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing the modern masters promise very little they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hidingplaces they ascend into the heavens they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows such were the professors wordsrather let me say such the words of the fateenounced to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankensteinmore far more will i achieve treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation i closed not my eyes that night my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it by degrees after the mornings dawn sleep came i awoke and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m krempe had exhibited he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure i am happy said m waldman to have gained a disciple and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt of your success chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy including mathematics he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave thus ended a day memorable to me it decided my future destiny chapter 4 from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable in m waldman i found a true friend his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnelhouses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret remember i am not recording the vision of a madman the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted that cannot be listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now found it impossible renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hidingplaces who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnelhouses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit it was a most beautiful season never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected i knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind if this rule were always observed if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved csar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale and your looks remind me to proceed my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leavessights which before always yielded me supreme delightso deeply was i engrossed in my occupation the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a most painful degree the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become the energy of my purpose alone sustained me my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete chapter 5 it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet it was already one in the morning the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the halfextinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dunwhite sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the graveworms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch i had gazed on him while unfinished he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived i passed the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridges ancient mariner continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence it stopped just where i was standing and on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out my dear frankenstein exclaimed he how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval his presence brought back to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many months calm and serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walked towards my college clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt you may easily believe said he how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of bookkeeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge it gives me the greatest delight to see you but tell me how you left my father brothers and elizabeth very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watching for several nights you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free i trembled excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself i then paused and a cold shivering came over me i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast but i was unable to contain myself it was not joy only that possessed me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him my dear victor cried he what for gods sake is the matter do not laugh in that manner how ill you are what is the cause of all this do not ask me cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room he can tell oh save me save me i imagined that the monster seized me i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months during all that time henry was my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion dearest clerval exclaimed i how kind how very good you are to me this whole winter instead of being spent in study as you promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion but you will forgive me you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself but get well as fast as you can and since you appear in such good spirits i may speak to you on one subject may i not i trembled one subject what could it be could he allude to an object on whom i dared not even think compose yourself said clerval who observed my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitates you but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence is that all my dear henry how could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards those dear dear friends whom i love and who are so deserving of my love if this is your present temper my friend you will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you it is from your cousin i believe chapter 6 clerval then put the following letter into my hands it was from my own elizabeth my dearest cousin you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account you are forbidden to writeto hold a pen yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that is over now clerval writes that indeed you are getting better i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting get welland return to us you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly your fathers health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application he looks upon study as an odious fetter his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us the blue lake and snowclad mountainsthey never change and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelicashe looked so frankhearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little wives but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victorone lineone word will be a blessing to us ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters we are sincerely grateful adieu my cousin take care of yourself and i entreat you write elizabeth lavenza geneva march 18th 17 dear dear elizabeth i exclaimed when i had read her letter i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply m krempe was not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m waldman dn the fellow cried he why m clerval i assure you he has outstript us all ay stare if you please but it is nevertheless true a youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university and if he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenanceay ay continued he observing my face expressive of suffering m frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of themselves you know m clerval i was myself when young but that wears out in a very short time m krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellowpupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of rosesin the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring i felt this delay very bitterly for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants the winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited i acceded with pleasure to this proposition i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country we passed a fortnight in these perambulations my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellowcreatures and rendered me unsocial but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy the present season was indeed divine the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings he exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing his conversation was full of imagination and very often in imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion at other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon the peasants were dancing and every one we met appeared gay and happy my own spirits were high and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity chapter 7 on my return i found the following letter from my father my dear victor you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness and how victor can i relate our misfortune absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings william is deadthat sweet child whose smiles delighted and warmed my heart who was so gentle yet so gay victor he is murdered i will not attempt to console you but will simply relate the circumstances of the transaction last thursday may 7th i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual it was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house he was not there we returned again with torches for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless the print of the murders finger was on his neck he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was very earnest to see the corpse at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed o god i have murdered my darling child she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted but they will not restore my beloved william come dearest victor you alone can console elizabeth she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death her words pierce my heart we are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling come victor not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies your affectionate and afflicted father alphonse frankenstein geneva may 12th 17 clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving news from my friends i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands my dear frankenstein exclaimed henry when he perceived me weep with bitterness are you always to be unhappy my dear friend what has happened i motioned him to take up the letter while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation tears also gushed from the eyes of clerval as he read the account of my misfortune i can offer you no consolation my friend said he your disaster is irreparable what do you intend to do to go instantly to geneva come with me henry to order the horses during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation he could only express his heartfelt sympathy poor william said he dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably to feel the murderers grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain he can no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivors clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend my journey was very melancholy at first i wished to hurry on for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends but when i drew near my native town i slackened my progress i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six years how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they were done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive fear overcame me i dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although i was unable to define them i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplated the lake the waters were placid all around was calm and the snowy mountains the palaces of nature were not changed by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my journey towards geneva the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i wept like a child dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue and placid is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me night also closed around and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva the gates of the town were already shut and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city the sky was serene and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered as i could not pass through the town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe its progress it advanced the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head it was echoed from salve the juras and the alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copt another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the mle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on with a hasty step this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits i clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me i stood fixed gazing intently i could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dmon to whom i had given life what did he there could he be i shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother no sooner did that idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth my teeth chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support the figure passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child he was the murderer i could not doubt it the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursuing the devil but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont salve a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south he soon reached the summit and disappeared i remained motionless the thunder ceased but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget the whole train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside its departure two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life and was this his first crime alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery had he not murdered my brother no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me day dawned and i directed my steps towards the town the gates were open and i hastened to my fathers house my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salve these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent it was about five in the morning when i entered my fathers house i told the servants not to disturb the family and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he still remained to me i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantelpiece it was an historical subject painted at my fathers desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb was rustic and her cheek pale but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity below this picture was a miniature of william and my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i was thus engaged ernest entered he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me welcome my dearest victor said he ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting selfaccusationspoor william he was our darling and our pride tears unrestrained fell from my brothers eyes a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster i tried to calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin she most of all said ernest requires consolation she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother and that made her very wretched but since the murderer has been discovered the murderer discovered good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it is impossible one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountainstream with a straw i saw him too he was free last night i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accents of wonder but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime justine moritz poor poor girl is she the accused but it is wrongfully every one knows that no one believes it surely ernest no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate and upon their deposition justine was apprehended on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner this was a strange tale but it did not shake my faith and i replied earnestly you are all mistaken i know the murderer justine poor good justine is innocent at that instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william we do also unfortunately replied my father for indeed i had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly my dear father you are mistaken justine is innocent if she is god forbid that she should suffer as guilty she is to be tried today and i hope i sincerely hope that she will be acquitted this speech calmed me i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her my tale was not one to announce publicly its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world we were soon joined by elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcomed me with the greatest affection your arrival my dear cousin said she fills me with hope you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own our misfortune is doubly hard to us we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate if she is condemned i never shall know joy more but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william she is innocent my elizabeth said i and that shall be proved fear nothing but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing she wept dearest niece said my father dry your tears if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality chapter 8 we passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock when the trial was to commence my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a marketwoman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer she returned to the house about eight oclock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice god knows she said how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chne a village situated at about a league from geneva on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the marketwoman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket but here also i am checked i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly did the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her a murmur of approbation followed elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial i believed in her innocence i knew it could the dmon who had i did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony the tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i went to the court my lips and throat were parched i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit the ballots had been thrown they were all black and justine was condemned i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heartsickening despair that i then endured the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt that evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive this was strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean had my eyes deceived me and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result my cousin replied i it is decided as you may have expected all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape but she has confessed this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justines innocence alas said she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end her hands were manacled and her head rested on her knees she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also oh justine said she why did you rob me of my last consolation i relied on your innocence and although i was then very wretched i was not so miserable as i am now and do you also believe that i am so very very wicked do you also join with my enemies to crush me to condemn me as a murderer her voice was suffocated with sobs rise my poor girl said elizabeth why do you kneel if you are innocent i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession i did confess but i confessed a lie i confessed that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none to support me all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition what could i do in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie and now only am i truly miserable she paused weeping and then continued i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune justine shook her head mournfully i do not fear to die she said that pang is past god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty i could not answer no justine said elizabeth he is more convinced of your innocence than i was for even when he heard that you had confessed he did not credit it i truly thank him in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself she indeed gained the resignation she desired but i the true murderer felt the neverdying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away i wish cried she that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of halfsuppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so and on the morrow justine died elizabeths heartrending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished on the scaffold as a murderess from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth this also was my doing and my fathers woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thriceaccursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early muchloved friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving youhe bids you weep to shed countless tears happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments thus spoke my prophetic soul as torn by remorse horror and despair i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and justine the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts chapter 9 nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear justine died she rested and i was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove sleep fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more i persuaded myself was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me solitude was my only consolationdeep dark deathlike solitude my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i loved your brothertears came into his eyes as he spokebut is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it is also a duty owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit for society this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyif i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shoreoften i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguished every hope i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base i wished to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine our house was the house of mourning my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself these events have affected me god knows how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our peace and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix i had visited it frequently during my boyhood six years had passed since then i was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more surefooted and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotenceand i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings i passed the bridge of plissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it soon after i entered the valley of chamounix this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields immense glaciers approached the road i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles and its tremendous dme overlooked the valley a tingling longlost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more then again the kindly influence ceased to acti found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myselfor in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion chapter 10 i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me the icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presencechamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day they congregated round me the unstained snowy mountaintop the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the cloudsthey all gathered round me and bade me be at peace where had they fled when the next morning i awoke all of soulinspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats what were rain and storm to me my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and evermoving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it is a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i looked on the valley beneath vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us we rest a dream has power to poison sleep we rise one wandring thought pollutes the day we feel conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away it is the same for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow nought may endure but mutability it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy i exclaimed wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man i was troubled a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains i perceived as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom i had created i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approached his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes but i scarcely observed this rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt devil i exclaimed do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered i expected this reception said the dmon all men hate the wretched how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us you purpose to kill me how dare you sport thus with life do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed my rage was without bounds i sprang on him impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another he easily eluded me and said be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself my height is superior to thine my joints more supple but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend make me happy and i shall again be virtuous begone i will not hear you there can be no community between you and me we are enemies begone or let us try our strength in a fight in which one must fall how can i move thee will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion believe me frankenstein i was benevolent my soul glowed with love and humanity but am i not alone miserably alone you my creator abhor me what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing they spurn and hate me the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge i have wandered here many days the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction shall i not then hate them who abhor me i will keep no terms with my enemies i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve but hear me the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned listen to me frankenstein you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands why do you call to my remembrance i rejoined circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed although i curse myself be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form thus i relieve thee my creator he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you hear my tale it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness these motives urged me to comply with his demand we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock the air was cold and the rain again began to descend we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale chapter 11 it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night i was a poor helpless miserable wretch i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the raindropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters the family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as i conjectured to rest chapter 12 i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy they possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every luxury they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply did they really express pain i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milkhouse drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace beauty and delicate complexions but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth from this time felix was more employed and the heartmoving indications of impending famine disappeared their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was starlight i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful but i did not then understand the signification of these terms my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease it was as the ass and the lapdog yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy chapter 13 i now hasten to the more moving part of my story i shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which from what i had been have made me what i am spring advanced rapidly the weather became fine and the skies cloudless it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labourthe old man played on his guitar and the children listened to himthat i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided her eyes were dark but gentle although animated her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian agatha the evergentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken while i improved in speech i also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys ruins of empires i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them chapter 14 some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements illsuited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont cenis to leghorn where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding he did not succeed they remained confined for five months before the trial took place the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheardof oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate a few days after the turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover chapter 15 such was the history of my beloved cottagers it impressed me deeply i learned from the views of social life which it developed to admire their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage they consisted of paradise lost a volume of plutarchs lives and the sorrows of werter the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the sorrows of werter besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a neverending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them the volume of plutarchs lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone i remembered adams supplication to his creator but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathised with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage i knocked who is there said the old man come in i entered pardon this intrusion said i i am a traveller in want of a little rest you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire enter said de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you do not trouble yourself my kind host i have food it is warmth and rest only that i need i sat down and a silence ensued i knew that every minute was precious to me yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence the interview when the old man addressed me by your language stranger i suppose you are my countryman are you french no but i was educated by a french family and understand that language only i am now going to claim the protection of some friends whom i sincerely love and of whose favour i have some hopes are they germans no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious selfinterest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair they are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster that is indeed unfortunate but if you are really blameless cannot you undeceive them i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome where do these friends reside near this spot the old man paused and then continued if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting may i know the names and residence of those friends i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial great god exclaimed the old man who are you at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel chapter 16 cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his fathers feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went in search of food when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances do you consider said his companion to him that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination it is utterly useless replied felix we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place felix trembled violently as he said this he and his companion entered the cottage in which they remained for a few minutes and then departed i never saw any of the family of de lacey more i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of the habitation i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed from my hidingplace and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and i fainted for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure but my toils now drew near a close and in two months from this time i reached the environs of geneva it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hidingplace among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me he struggled violently let me go he cried monster ugly wretch you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces you are an ogre let me go or i will tell my papa boy you will never see your father again you must come with me hideous monster let me go my papa is a syndiche is m frankensteinhe will punish you you dare not keep me frankenstein you belong then to my enemyto him towards whom i have sworn eternal revenge you shall be my first victim the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart i grasped his throat to silence him and in a moment he lay dead at my feet i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hidingplace i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joyimparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fairest thy lover is nearhe who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within menot i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create chapter 17 the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me i do refuse it i replied and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent you are in the wrong replied the fiend and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those icerifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my archenemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth a fiendish rage animated him as he said this his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold but presently he calmed himself and proceeded i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold for that one creatures sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow you swear i said to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the icecaves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said i consent to your demand on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever and every other place in the neighbourhood of man as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway restingplace and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a banas if i had no right to claim their sympathiesas if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life chapter 18 day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father calling me aside thus addressed me i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all i trembled violently at his exordium and my father continued i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all selfcommand all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toilsone consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clervaland yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky this is what it is to live he cried now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairyland and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving he was a being formed in the very poetry of nature his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldlyminded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrowd from the eye wordsworths tintern abbey and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creatorhas this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland and we resolved to post the remainder of our way for the wind was contrary and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwichplaces which i had heard of even in my country at length we saw the numerous steeples of london st pauls towering above all and the tower famed in english history chapter 19 london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwellingplaces we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by ennui the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and selfsacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors i could pass my life here said he to me and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine but he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are for ever on the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dmons disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st bernards well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrews and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom chapter 20 i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation they might even hate each other the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dmon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage the door opened and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared shutting the door he approached me and said in a smothered voice you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and misery i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy my hopes begone i do break my promise never will i create another like yourself equal in deformity and wickedness slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master obey the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remainsrevenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict devil cease and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice i have declared my resolution to you and i am no coward to bend beneath words leave me i am inexorable it is well i go but remember i shall be with you on your weddingnight i started forward and exclaimed villain before you sign my deathwarrant be sure that you are yourself safe i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his wordsi will be with you on your weddingnight that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a dmon whom i had myself created i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a deathknell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishingboat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dmon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clervalall left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it some hours passed thus but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south almost spent as i was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am you will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste but you will not be consulted as to your quarters i promise you i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions why do you answer me so roughly i replied surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably i do not know said the man what the custom of the english may be but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an illlooking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to mr kirwins to give an account of yourself who is mr kirwin why am i to give an account of myself is not this a free country ay sir free enough for honest folks mr kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death i must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which i am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection chapter 21 i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner the son confirmed his fathers account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured and i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings are you better now sir said she i replied in the same language with a feeble voice i believe i am but if it be all true if indeed i did not dream i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french i fear that this place is very shocking to you can i do anything to make you more comfortable i thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge that is my least concern i am by a course of strange events become the most miserable of mortals persecuted and tortured as i am and have been can death be any evil to me nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of any kind this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event tell me what new scene of death has been acted and whose murder i am now to lament your family is perfectly well said mr kirwin with gentleness and someone a friend is come to visit you i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony oh take him away i cannot see him for gods sake do not let him enter mr kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance he could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone i should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance my father cried i while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure is my father indeed come how kind how very kind but where is he why does he not hasten to me my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it nothing at this moment could have given me greater pleasure than the arrival of my father i stretched out my hand to him and cried are you then safeand elizabethand ernest my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state i shed tears alas yes my father replied i some destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me and i must live to fulfil it or surely i should have died on the coffin of henry we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring maladie du pays to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havredegrace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare i felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me the dashing waves were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible chapter 22 the voyage came to an end we landed and proceeded to paris i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my fathers care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill he wished me to seek amusement in society i abhorred the face of man oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride alas my father said i how little do you know me human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the cause of thisi murdered her william justine and henrythey all died by my hands my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe upon this occasion my father said with an expression of unbounded wonder my dearest victor what infatuation is this my dear son i entreat you never to make such an assertion again i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost selfviolence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland i received the following letter from elizabeth my dear friend it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being the case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dearest victor answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truthdo you not love another you have travelled you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations but this is false reasoning i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word honour all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity do not let this letter disturb you do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness elizabeth lavenza geneva may 18th 17 this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threat of the fiendi will be with you on your weddingnight such was my sentence and on that night would the dmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death well be it so a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end if he were vanquished i should be a free man alas what freedom such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed to be with me on my weddingnight yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter was calm and affectionate i fear my beloved girl i said little happiness remains for us on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we returned to geneva the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks i saw a change in her also she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i was the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possessed me sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for the guilty there is no peace the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with elizabeth i remained silent have you then some other attachment none on earth i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with delight let the day therefore be fixed and on it i will consecrate myself in life or death to the happiness of my cousin my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words i shall be with you on your weddingnight i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the everwatchful and nicer eye of elizabeth she looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance i shut up as well as i could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her it was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day the day was fair the wind favourable all smiled on our nuptial embarkation those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness we passed rapidly along the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salve the pleasant banks of montalgre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it i took the hand of elizabeth you are sorrowful my love ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy be happy my dear victor replied elizabeth there is i hope nothing to distress you and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie the sun sank lower in the heavens we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever chapter 23 it was eight oclock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked what is it that agitates you my dear victor what is it you fear oh peace peace my love replied i this night and all will be safe but this night is dreadful very dreadful i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figureher bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated for a moment only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife i rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i hired men to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose if i looked up i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection tears streamed from my eyes the rain had ceased for a moment and i saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before they had then been observed by elizabeth nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the clouds might lower but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i see him now excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and their delighthis elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life having few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain cursed cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way he was unable to rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms what then became of me i know not i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their causethe monster whom i had created the miserable dmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness be assured sir said he no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain i thank you replied i listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm i had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested i saw him sometimes shudder with horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was painted on his countenance when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned he however answered mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment that cannot be but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium man i cried how ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom cease you know not what it is you say i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action chapter 24 my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dared not die and leave my adversary in being when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i lived their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dmon who caused this misery until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion but the furies possessed me as i concluded and rage choked my utterance i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains reechoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a wellknown and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed i pursued him and for many months this has been my task guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the dmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury my reign is not yet overthese words were legible in one of these inscriptionsyou live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refreshed come on my enemy we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversarys gibe to meet and grapple with him some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horrorstruck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey i exchanged my landsledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the frozen ocean and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions i departed from land i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a wellknown form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud but this was not the time for delay i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some icerock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea was heard the thunder of its progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not liveswear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiendlike malice hear him not call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart i will hover near and direct the steel aright walton in continuation august 26th 17 you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed me and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected such a monster has then really existence i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration sometimes i endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creatures formation but on this point he was impenetrable are you mad my friend said he or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy since you have preserved my narration said he i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension his eloquence is forcible and touching nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall when younger said he i believed myself destined for some great enterprise my feelings are profound but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements this sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures when i reflected on the work i had completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust all my speculations and hopes are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete i trod heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the idea of their effects from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i once was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency rarely visited my heart a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise must i then lose this admirable being i have longed for a friend i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me behold on these desert seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea i thank you walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die my beloved sister september 2d i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return years will pass and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heartfelt expectations is in prospect more terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely children you may be happy heaven bless you and make you so my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence when he speaks they no longer despair he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are molehills which will vanish before the resolutions of man these feelings are transitory each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair september 5th a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you yet i cannot forbear recording it we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation frankenstein has daily declined in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friendhis eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlesslyi was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin they entered and their leader addressed me he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour turning towards the men he said what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easily turned from your design did you not call this a glorious expedition and wherefore was it glorious not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers and terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome for this was it a glorious for this was it an honourable undertaking you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides why that requires not this preparation ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men were moved they looked at one another and were unable to reply i spoke i told them to retire and consider of what had been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their courage would return they retired and i turned towards my friend but he was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships september 7th the die is cast i have consented to return if we are not destroyed thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision i come back ignorant and disappointed it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience september 12th it is past i am returning to england i have lost my hopes of utility and glory i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond september 9th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction we were in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north a breeze sprang from the west and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly free when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them loud and longcontinued frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked the cause of the tumult they shout i said because they will soon return to england do you then really return alas yes i cannot withstand their demands i cannot lead them unwillingly to danger and i must return do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back and fainted it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct at length he opened his eyes he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient i sat by his bed watching him his eyes were closed and i thought he slept but presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said alas the strength i relied on is gone i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and wellbeing this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil he destroyed my friends he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction was mine but i have failed when actuated by selfish and vicious motives i asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries yet why do i say this i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble my tears flow my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation i am interrupted what do these sounds portend it is midnight the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describegigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion that is also my victim he exclaimed in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion your repentance i said is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived and do you dream said the dmon do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power oh it is not thusnot thus interrupted the being yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work is nearly complete neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done but it requires my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched he is dead who called me into being and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my happiness some years ago when the images which this world affords first opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were all to me i should have wept to die now it is my only consolation polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction but it was not so thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever but soon he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm i shall die and what i now feel be no longer felt soon these burning miseries will be extinct i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and exult in the agony of the torturing flames the light of that conflagration will fade away my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds my spirit will sleep in peace or if it thinks it will not surely think thus farewell he sprang from the cabinwindow as he said this upon the ice raft
